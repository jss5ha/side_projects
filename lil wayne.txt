Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept

Gone
Rip rip, niggaI got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I said get him"
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie 
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli 
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'"
She say, "What's missin'?", "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratch his head, she say, "Get back in bed"
And she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say—ooh
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place!"
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share
I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told ya"
She gave me the salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga

We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
Now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga 
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! 
You fuckin' with Wayne's? 
Bitch, gimme your phone! 
Let me, let me take this call real quick
 He on your fuckin' ringtone?

Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy

Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?

Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, "What up, Killa?"
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine

In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word

Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups

But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant

Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well

Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side

You don't know whether you're coming or going, but
You think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror, don't blow it
Woah, look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the
Mirror on the wall 
Here we are again 
Through my rise and fall 
You've been my only friend 
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?
Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..
Mirror on the wall
Here we are again 
Through my rise and fall 
You've been my only friend 
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am 
So why are we here 
Talking to each other again? 
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the...
Mirror on the wall

Through my rise and fall

I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain
Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games 
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games 
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames

I'm just a sucker for pain

Yeah
Four
Ahem!
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will 
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will
Yeah
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that "wine 'n' dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, "Choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she willBangladesh
Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Motherfucker, I'm ill
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it
Motherfucker, I'm ill
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say "Life ain't shit without me"
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 PeatYeah
C5
Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!
Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: "Don’t cry, stay tuned."
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise
Don't cry , don’t go 
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!
Don't cry 
Don't go 
Won't lie 
I fuckin' love you, whoa! 
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, "dun-dun-dun-dun-dun"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll
Don't cry 
Don't go 
Won't lie , I fuckin' love you, whoa!
Don't cry 
Don't go 
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa! 
Don't cry, stay tuned
And triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife
Rest in paradiseYeah, I put my shades on
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong

Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em

Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments

Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot firstI got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
‘Cause all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker
So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream: "Fuck 'em all!"
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole
My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm goneJust saw an alien saucer approaching from the sky
Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy
Fo’ fo’ bulldog: my motherfucking pet

But if she get greedy, I’ma starve her to death
Top down, it’s upset
Been fucking the world and nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening

The orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile
I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit
In the foreign car that I could talk to and shit

Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain’t never lyin' yea
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die
God bless Amerika

The end of time is like a hour away
Damn, military minded, lost and can’t find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea
Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don’t play, boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of command, I’m the missing link
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet
Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?Oww! Uh-huh

"How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's not yo cheese"
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay"
I can't only have one and I ain't tryin' to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help

And I just wanna act like a porno-flickin' actor
I Anita Bake her, now she caught up in the Rapture
I got so much chips I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy motha-fudge cake, now tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake, soo-woo, think it's voodoo
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate
She so so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir
Because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin, Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment
With Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feelin' of me bein' the shit
'Cause I was leavin' skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere: innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD thing, tape deck
IPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
So wrap it up!
But he's so sweet she wanna lick the wrapper
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumpsFly

Yeah, it's Mr. Michael Myers, man 
Word to the MoneyBagg, I keep it coming in 
By the way we work you think I had a twin 
I'm tryna run the game, it ain't no subbing in 
You can't phase me, sliding from a dangerous life 
Always down to ball, I'm tryna drain these nights
See the smoke clouds through the entertainment lights
The way it go down we taking fours and keeping doors tight 
We at the top, end of discussion 
They mixing alcohol and that 'tussin
The demon in they eyes and they clutchin' 
I feed 'em Adderall and they bussin', yeah 
I kept the towel, not throwing in
I'm riding around in my ends
I got a driver for the Bent' to drive me 'round when I'm bent
I keep some pussy just to lick to help me out when I vent
She wanna hit that shit again, nah 
That's the phone call, when my blood ring
It's Tha Carter V, let the thugs sing 
Let it fly 
Let it fly like the birds in the sky 
Hotter than the weather in July 
I done did so much I can't decide 
Word, word to my guys

It's alive, it's alive, I'm revived, it's C5
Been arrived, kiss the sky, did the time
Please advise, it is advised to be advised
And we advise you not fuck with me and mine
And keep in mind that we don't mind losing our minds
Free your mind, read your mind, read your mind
Body take a week to find, the cops gon' be like, "Never mind"
What's on your mind?
Put the pistol to your mind and blow your mind
Control your mind, mindfreak, no sober mind
I'm so behind, but front line
You crossed the line, and you better know your lines
And if you getting out of line, I hang you with a clothing line
Wring you like an open line, keep your stanky ho in line
Them hoes be lying, it's a thin line, and I know you know the line
Second line, second line, Tunechi got effective lines
Rough edges like a box of Checkers fries, that's a line
Catch the line, American flag, less stars, extra lines
Stretch the line, skip the line, 'til you no more next in line
Yeah, Tunechi-Tune a lunatic, my goonie-goons the gooniest
Run inside your room and kill you and who you roomin' with
The Uzi with the booty clip; more than one, I'm too-equipped
Talking 'bout some fake niggas, based on true events
Trying not to get pinched, smoking on a stupid stench
Lookin' in the mirror tryin' to figure where my pupils went
Flashy with a boujee bitch, Travy, that's my hooligan 
Take the T off Tunechi and look at it as the crucifix, bitch
C5, best rapper alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let it flyYou cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken
They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say, now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen 
When all of the lights, they get low 
And all of the curtains, they close 
You cannot break down  what can't be broken
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros 
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes

Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil' a day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break
You cannot break down what can't be broken 
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

Someone said, "Nigga, they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like, "I think they just might be scared of me now" 
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day , niggas wrong every day 
Gone, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day

In the new house, we got the twapShe owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches
And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches
Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not forever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for "Fuck you"
No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round you me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitchesYou who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?
I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
'Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushin' the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargainin' on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing
Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit
And got too fuckin' comfy
'Cause we still fuckin' hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin' faded, aw yeah I'm fuckin' faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aw yeah, I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin' all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out
Uh, stop playin', I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, Sheneneh, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock .40′s, nigga you got 80 problems

Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how-much-you-love-your-lady" money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga

I'm a grown-ass Blood, stop playin' with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’

The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong

I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lam, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in the wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail,  I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, Holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, 'Cock-a-doodle'
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu,  glory unto you, glory
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-hoo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I'll sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga,  I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar,  I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, 'Surprise', but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas' soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely, when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord
Am I talkin' crazy, too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads' elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private,  tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's cruisin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'emGod bless america...

Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em

Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses
Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah

Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech
Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, 
Thank you, thank you all, I am President CarterLook what you made me do

I found the needle in the haystack, put the thread through
I tried to stitch the wound back up, but I just bled through
Yeah, it's compensation over conversation 
Lord, I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces 
Lord, this game is a vampire 
Blood, you gotta protect your neck
It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord
But fuck that, nigga, got it drawn out
Fuck that nigga, I'ma ball out
The day you met me is the day Hell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out 
I'm still in the buildin'
I just had to knock a couple walls down, had to kick y'all out 
Life is a movie, but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin'
And walk out
Takin' over, Lord I'm takin' over
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga
And all I do is smoke, fuck, and thrash, nigga, ayy!
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2 
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi – niggas don't appreciate you 
You've been down since day one
It meant nothin' on day two 
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow, and to say, too
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school
And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over 
The old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over
If so, then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda...Soulja Boy on the beat

'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like "A Milli" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas

Addin' Hammam Spas with tannin' booths, nigga

Lord I, was so blinded by her highlights
She had me not checking my DM's neither my likes

If you're single tonightEverything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
But baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet
I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, said I'm good
Oh, I been good
I've been out there puttin' down that work
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good
This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfuckers
Remember, don't you remember?
I been good, we goodAs I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon 
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down
I turn into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin’ on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?
 / Both]
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I’ll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon 
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon 
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you 
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah
I'm in this bitch
Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
"Don't let the money come between us"
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, "Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out"
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, "Let that shit work itself out"
"Let that shit work itself out"
C5
Yeah, back in this bitch
Tune you left this bitch
Like you knew this bitch was gon' let your ass back in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, "Tune, you knew me for way too long"
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, "Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out, let it all work out" 
"Let it all work out, let it all work out"
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, "I'm sorry for even apologizing"
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet
Yeah, and he said
"Let it all work out" 
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
Let it all work out 
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out" 
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all—"
"Let it all work out" 
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all—"
Love you, DwayneShout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5, since '05!
Know that!
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass witchyo' fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with ya breasts showin'
Like a salad no dressing, take ya to ya favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when yo ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And I'mma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy
Coffee, brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait it wasn't
Oh and I forgot I'll take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen, my homeboy like your sister
Maybe they can bake some cousins, ooh isn't that sweet
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, "I-I love you too"
It's Wayne's world, she say, "What is this world coming to?"
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, "Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
"What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of, my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?
I loved the pictures
I needed that, I swear I did
I was just thinking about you when you sent them too
You don't believe me? I know
D5, what up 5?
I-I love you too...I doMy niggas been stuntin' since way back when
CNN, I got news for you haters
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lying
69, that's a favor for a favor
Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take
Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, "Tune, not in my mouth," damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like "excuse you"
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation
I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, "See, you gon' drink your life away"
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8

Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside

I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei

Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea

And violets are blue, roses are red
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead
Wish I could give you this feeling

Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, "You're a son of a gun"
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, "I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, "Nothing's easy"
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, "Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious"
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, "Y'all young. You know y'all young." But I said, "Be the best father you can be," you know. And truly, he is that. I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law

Murder she wrote on a notepad, nigga
Light that nigga up, smoke that nigga
Stomp that nigga, roast that nigga
I walk around with this shotgun
And this bitch bigger than me, nigga
Don't open up your fuckin' mouth
'Cause I'll pull the trigger like teeth, nigga
Shoot 'em up then leave, nigga, I smell Summer's Eve, nigga
We shoot first, it's better to give than receive, nigga

And we don't shoot in the air
I can't fuck with these niggas, man, these niggas gummy bears
Hair trigger on the gun, I pull that motherfucker's hair
It's like, man, you can't trust nobody
I don't even have a trust fund
Don't buck, nigga, don't stunt, nigga
Don't duck, nigga, 'cause I duck hunt
Bitch, rock with me, that Glock with me
That chopper with me, obviously
I'mma empty this motherfucker
That's fifty shots, approximately
Now fuck with me, get fucked over
Emergency room, rushed over
Hollow tips, in the clip
My gun loaded, yours sober
I pull your card like a lawn mower
Fall back or I'm goin' forward
I see you got your gun drawn
I'll send you back to the drawin' board
Lil Tunechi

You don't talk back, when I cock back

Yeah!
Walking 'round this motherfucker limpin'
'Cause the nose on the pistol 'bout as long as Scottie Pippen's
On the molly and I'm twisted, throw your body with the fishes
Double back around that corner and embodyin' the witness
Uh, real niggas don't talk much, do drive-by's and walk-up's
Lame rappers that talk tough get a broke jaw, star-struck
I don't fuck with lame niggas, I got good aim, nigga
Pop a pill, pop you, my nickname is Pain Killer
I'm still that same nigga; Eastside, I rep that
Pussy niggas better get right, or where I see you, you get left at
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk
Gudda

Hollygrove, I throw it up like I'm trying to lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level, you can't get on my level
You gon' need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches, like Magic
Abracadabra, I'm up, like Viagra
I just do this shit for my clique, like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'mma keep it on my channel

And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said
I tell my girl "When you fuck me, better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could, she gon' fuck me good"
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it

Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga

Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared
Yeah I know your name  yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah 
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points

Too cool for school, but I sold cool points to schoolboys
Tell the cops, We don’t name drop, that's like droppin newborns
Nigga you crazy
You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes made me
Nigga tell me somethin I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me somethin I haven’t seen
And give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I never be in
I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me vs. Me, I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputy, big letter B
Need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything
From amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than nectarine and Grenadine, ha!

She say she love me, that's the molly talking
She about to blow me, like a signing bonus
She got a nigga but he ain't me bitch
I'm the original gangster, he the remix
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss yo momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say, I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him
I get Adam like Yolonda
Young Money Cash Money, Obama
It's fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence
But I swear to God he heard it, yeah
And I swear to God I ain't nervous, nah
I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
Bitch I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
I see you turning up but your turn up ain't working
Baby, I just want some mouth and lip service
She gone ride this dick like the Kentucky Derby
On that Pat-ron, I'm swerving, game tight like virgins
I got a bad bitch, she Persian, call her AK when she's squirting
You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As long as I got a face, yo bitch got a place to sit
Yea, I'm wilding off them shroomies
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi
All my chicks be bougie
Wanna hold hands then watch movies
I be goddamned, make a nigga lose it
Ain't no talking- lets get to it
Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing
Bitch I'll leave that pussy with bruises
Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
I swear to God I ain't nervous
No, you know I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin and slurping, my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
You fuck with Tunechi, you'll end up a missing person
She got Lil Tunechi on her booty, in cursive
I'm getting head behind the Maybach curtains
YaI'ma just leave this right here
The greatest mixtape series of all time
Uh-uh-uh-mmmm
Care to debate me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sick shit
I thought so
Keep that shit on Twitter, y'all ain't lit, y'all litter
Keep that shit in your shitter, or eat that shit, don't spit up, rrr!
Keep my bad bitch did up, keep my main bitch put up
Watchin' me do push-ups
She was playin' with herself and I looked up, damn
Your thot need to get her look up, ugh
You're plottin' on me, my foot up, ugh
Your squad ain't hard, that's cushion, ugh
That ain't sauce, that's pudding, ugh
Tunechi 'cross her bosom, damn
Shooting up the jurors, damn
Don't name my pistol, I named the trigger
"Benjamin Button," push him, bam!
Y'all just pussy, get buried together and let 'em play footsie
Y'all just wussy, I got some bullies
Gon' pull up in hoodies and come take a look-see
Better play hooky, I got some hookers hookin' up with politicans
And some athletes, and some college niggas
Send your missus on all kind of missions
I'm the sickest nigga skippin' doctors visits
But my pots is pissy, smokin' hockey sticky
Put a stockin' on my face and hit a lick and
When the shit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, neither Minnie, Mickey
I don't fuck with cops, that's the piggly-wiggly
Fuck my bitches' friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your bitch is giving me her twenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, J.C. Penney's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winning, win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to business, and we laugh at sentencing
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artist or a starving artist
In the kitchen, restaurant, and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeerers
Now, your good luck looking like you cracking mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples?
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now, we at his villa aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
And I catch a triple, flip, kick, jiujitsu
Throwing pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than The Simpsons
And her man a simper, so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec, I'll go at your neck
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrr!
Yeah, cannibalism, going animalistic in a land of civilians
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave your la familia behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got their eyes wide, but too blind to see it
With friends like those
It make me text all my enemies and tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walking 'round my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talking out their bowel movers
Turn their homies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo you
Tell a doc that's tryna save your life
And running wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it
We put out the movie, win awards
She got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
Niggas prostituting
These rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
En route to Houston with the contribution
Full of Monster juices, Mazda too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrr!

Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow
I got me a new ho, and now it's a duo
One went to college and one went to JuCo
I had to ask 'em, "What's four plus two, though?" Rrr!

A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga

Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'

LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'

Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Ne-Yo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane

The love I'm sending
An't making it through to your heart
I hope you hear me
Pain! Since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horseshoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin' that you forgive me, give me another chance
I'm needin' it like a kidney, I don't wanna advance
Give me back her hands, give me back her touch
I don't ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
But everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
Cause um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster... BANG!
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
I see you hidin' it mama
You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top
Keep doin' your thing
But there is something that you forgot
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star under sunlight
See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl and you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap
You've been hiding 
Never letting it show
Always trying 
To keep it under control 
You got it down 
And you're well on your way to the top
But I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness, shawty
But I hope you haven't forgot about me
Up in the living room watchin' SportsCenter
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me "butter," I called you "babe"
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, damn!
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heartOohh, ooh
So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special
Oohh, ooh
So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special
Uh, boy shorts, wife beater
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer
She was sleeping on me, but she's a light sleeper
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader
I talk shit, I hope it matters
We climax, without the ladder
Can't desert the future, no Nevada
Her body is a weapon, ratatat her
I spent the night in heaven, I slept with an angel
And when we finish, I swear that pussy said thank you
I said, "You're Very Welcome" I'm so well mannered
And I go down south, Louisiana
Baby won't you spend the night

And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
Then we take a shower together, and wash each others back
And if she kick it off, I'ma run it back
And then she say my name, like I forgot it
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt
Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze
Yeah, body language, girl let's talk about it

I told my son that "Whatever the sun touch is yours, little nigga"
I told my daughter, "Don't give up your love to a poor little nigga"
I told my bitch if she cheat then she making a poor decision
I told that bitch if she leave then she leavin' the solar system
But hoes don't listen
But I'm on the road to riches, and she can't ignore the engine
I bought myself a medallion that cost an Azure, my nigga
I don't know, guess I was bored, my nigga
Tell foreign hoes "I'm El Señor", my nigga

And you passed that shit like a laxative
Ain't where or why you trap, it's who you trappin' with
For me it's about who I travel with

All my bros is Gs, take a guess at what the code is
Pour a four in, fuck it pour some more in
Rest In Peace Lil Peep, we already miss you homie
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said "I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edgeAhem, Weezy F
Young Money, Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3, ladies and gentlemen
And you know me
Let's go
You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it I'mma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas
And fuck your hospital, Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like c-y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was the Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a little intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See my World is Different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thang
And you know that I’m gon' ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don’t worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
‘Cause the sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I’m gonna be in it
The sky is the limit
Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me
My flow is art, unique
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is "Eat"
By any means, and you just sardines
I got the 40 cal. tucked in my Prps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours
And I'mma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And I'mma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit, yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting
On the living room sofa
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit but I cannot forget the street
So you know that I'mma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Don't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit, yeah the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
If you don't remember nothing, man, the sky is the limitWeed and syrup, yeah
All I know is paper
I don't know these hoes
I like mouth in my lap
And pussy on my nose
And I'm bringin' home the bacon

And bodies on my nine
And I swear everyday

And a kamikaze squad
And you chicken parmesan

I dream that I'm in heaven
I dreamed I saw Lil Beezy
And smoked a 'gar with Wessy
All my niggas, Rest In Peace
And my enemy, rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep
They catch him
When he least expect 'em
Momma told me
"If you run these streets
Run these streets correctly"
Well, feet don't fail me now; I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows

To the mall
Two hoes
On my arm
Fur boots
When it's warm
Church shoes
To play ball
I'm spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me
All I love is paper
I don't love these hoes
Boy, that vest won't save you
Neither will heroes
Lord, they better hope you save him
Better catch the holy ghost
Holy moly, hockey mask like Halloween like OVO
Lord all I know is strippers, all they know is poles
All they sell is pussy, 'cause they done sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zero's
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord, all I know is paper
Big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is
That bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience
'Til I heard all aboard
They mad cause I be skatin'
At home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5k
I be spendin' 25k every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day
Cause Hood just came with them chickens
I don't want you in the house, bae
Plus we need the kitchen
Lord, trap house in abundance
We got trap houses in London
Y'all don't hear me
Hol' up

Watch me go up
My doors go up
When I show up
Why you show up?
Pick my bro up
Pick a O up
Hit the store up
Get a soda
Get us 4 cups
Split a 4 up
Then we slow up
Yeah you know us
Then we toast cups
And we post up
Don't approach us
We got toasters
That's my slime, like we ghostbust
And we both bust
Give no fucks
Take no stuff
And take your stuff
Then ho hunt
For some chocha
I know a ho
Who'll rock the boat
But I row her
I'm Noah, Lord
I remember when I was no one, Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita
I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimetres
Oh Lord
I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms
He died recent
So I hope heaven made more room for him
And I hope he see me
Cause if he didn't save that lil boy there would be no Weezy
Oh LordWelcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky 
You must be famous
This is how you live your life, different city every night 
You must be famous, famous
I'ma be on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, "Oh my God"
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, "Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me"
'Cause superstars don't sparkle, superstars beam

Message to my lawyer: "Don't let me make these bitches famous"
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, "Am I dreamin'?"
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, "Can you look this way? Can you look this way?"
Flash! I must be famous
Welcome to your name in lights 
All the lighters in the sky 
You must be famous

Whack weed get ashed out, put Persian rugs in the crack house

Catch you while you sleep, turn your sheets to maroon sheets
Them choppers turn your homeboys into amputees
And that's not a good look, momma was a chef, but daddy cooked the work
Said "I know it stank but it's good"
Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons
Leave it all out there, or leave nothin'

Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery

From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events
Lord

I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than

"You only live twice, slime"
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate, like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways

'Cause I am not a human being—part two!
Getting paid show money for walkthroughs
Letting all these hoes ride my dick: carpool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Ugh, what your man doing?
I pop his motherfucking top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed

Looking for the motherfucking man in the mirror
Running this shit like a faucet: Farrah
Barra-cuda, who the fuck you-uh?
I can make your bitch root for me like I grew her
Bodies in the sewer, tampons in manure
90 billion bitches on my stick like a skewer, that's swag
I'm a true Blood, bitch, no fangs
Been went pro, now I'm going pro-pane
Tell a bitch, "Get off me!" Bitch, get off me!
I got her over here blowing me like coffee
Decaffeinated, hand me that paper like I graduated
And I get head while it's decapitated, haha
Think it's a game? Nigga, come play
I'm with my killer Bs, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers, it's so strange
But this girl named Dana like to go anal
Shoot him in his head—what's that? A no-brainer
Plain ol' nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve, so don't be breaking my arm
I'd rather wring your fucking neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass—get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growing hair
Bitches sweating me like John Mayer or warm air
Man... Nuts and bananas
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?
If you fake, put a egg in your shoe and scramble
No rubber, I just fucked this piano, nigga!
Lew!
Do you!
Whoa!
Turn it up!
Mm!
Yeah!
Hello World!
As I always say...
I...
Am not...
A human being
2Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see? 
My-my scene just a crime scene
Got the high beams and the sirens, yeah
My team, we divide teams
Talkin' dirty money? Check the hygienes
All the dirty money get dry cleaned
Talkin' dirty money, Sam Rothstein
Had my goons kidnap your offsprings
While I was working on my golf swing
Ooh, sweet dreams, sour nightmares
It's a cold world, I got an ice grill
No one man should have all that power
If he can't afford to pay the light bill
I got a forcefield over my heartbeat
The window seal with no door key
I'm poppin' pills to feel more me
Cut off the wings now I'm soaring
And I never feel like poor me
I'd rather feel like the old me
I was born with wheels and I roll deep
I could make the devil get cold feet
Don't light the clove unless it's four leaf
Get a pussy wetter than a coral reef
On my face, I tatted me a fleur-de-lis
Should I get it covered with a coca leaf?
I could tell you better than you showed me
I could show you better than you told me
I'm an OG up in OT
And it's no sleep 'til it's roast beef
I better not hear a Little Bo-Peep
Better go figure, better go deep
Pass no judgement, pass your weed
I'm the GOAT nigga, no goatee
Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see?
Mmm, sippin' on purple like it's herbal
Bad brown bitch, Lisa Turtle

Different color diamonds, got a nigga lookin' like sherbert
Stepped to the plate, knocked it out the park
Eat a nigga face like a tiger shark
Dressed in all red like Olajuwon
My niggas hit your safe like the Holocaust
My niggas catch a case, feel like I got Moss'd
My nigga treat the K just like a loft
Got a lawyer and an agent but I'm the boss
And my heart always racin' but never lost
Hello? I was the illest nigga on child support
Now I'm lookin' at the riot report
Went and looking at the final score
Bedroom got revolvin' doors
Bitches in and out smilin' more
Than children smilin' at a carnival
Ain't got nothing in common but the common cold
Big Bs nigga, honor roll
Hold up, I think I found the flow
Started from the bottom bitch
Never been monogamous, never been monotonous
Never been anonymous, money is eunonymus
Always had accomplices, always had conglomerates
Always let the chopper clip stick out like a bottom lip
You runnin' out of time so you better know what time it is
You runnin' out of tears and you runnin' out of volunteers
Young Mula bitch, I die for the logo
Cocaine price low, call that a low blow
Tunechi like Pablo, kis in the rowboat
Tunechi in the yacht though, still don't showboat
Sippin' on the slowpoke, movin' like a tugboat
Smokin' like a steamboat, fuckin' on a love boat
Better read the ransom note before you read the love note
Don't know if it's sore throat, deep throat or cut throat
Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see?
Oh why am I so kamikaze
Why can't I stay in my seat? I'm so hyphy
Try me, why do I see these bloody bodies?
Why do I love what I see?
Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
R.I.P
If you can't live in peace, then you can die in peace
As your eyes close and mines bleed, I need VizineNo Ceilings
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
President got 'em in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it say 'Right now'
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial

Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti matte black, "Where they do that at?"

Carter Treys
I'm outYeah, yeah
Mmm...
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up
Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, "Why you leave your shit here?"
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout "What about how she feel?"
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
"Baby where my keys at?"
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up
I was talkin' to myself the other day
My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, "Pray"
She say, "I need a day", I said, "I need a bae"
She said, "Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way"
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say "Don't sweat your alarm"
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, "Let go my arm!"
She said...
I don't know who you are anymore​
Talking to the man in her mirror
I've been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
And she say, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up
She say, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's what's fucked up
She say we don't make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, now it's painless
We actin' like strangers
Like we don't know who we are anymore

It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand
'Cause you thought Lil Wayne was Weezy, but Weezy is Wayne
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I was watchin' TV the other day, right? Got this white guy on there talking 'bout black guys. Talking about how young black guys are targeted. Targeted by who? America.
You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up. One in every nine Black Americans are locked up. And see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail, a young motherfucker to jail, would be less to send his or her young ass to college.
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only..., I don't want to say only right, but shit... Only logic, by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found – You know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucka to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; level three, level four drug, shit like that.
Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood huh? Yeah.
You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared, I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out.
And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what?  Don't stop the track, that's the good weed.
You know what, I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him. Meanin', he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then you move in a sex offender, hahaha. Then give me a paper, haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.
Another thing; let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh, Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.
Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, "'spec before check," anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha.
Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhmm, hold on, um...
Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!
But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just, not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. but I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha.
You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him.
Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstoodShawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'ma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby

'Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you
Now she don't know about me but I'ma put her on it
And she ain't sure about me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight

With you baby
With you baby
With you and only youI mean it’s simple
Can’t fuck wit us
I got money on yo head, I don’t do my dirty work
I cut off my hands, I don’t even touch the work
I pray these niggas don’t fuck with me and I don’t like to curse in church

My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess
But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe
'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess
Yes, no pressure, it’s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess
I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into Petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe
'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more ones, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

Put it in the pot, let it steam, let it brew
Now watch me melt; don't burn yourself, 'cause –
I'm the Fireman, Fire, F-Fireman
I got that fire, I'm hollering, I got that fire, come and try me, and
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out
 You can spark it up and I'ma put you out
Yeah, riding by myself; well, really, not really 
So heavy in the trunk make the car pop a wheelie
Who? Weezy Baby, or call me Young Baby
My money 360, you only 180 
Half, of the game too lazy
Still sleeping on me but I'm 'bout to wake 'em, yep
I'm 'bout to take 'em to New Orleans and bake 'em, yeah
It's hot down here, take a walk with Satan, yeah
Come on mama, let the Carter make ya
Toss you like a fruit salad, strawberry-grape ya
They ball when they can, and I'm ballin' by nature
Addicted to the game, like Jordan and Payton
Y'all in the race, and me, I'm at the finish line
Been running for too long, it's time to give me mine
Straight down your chimney, in your living room, it's I
Weezy, allergic to wintertime — Hot!
I'm the Fireman, Fire, F-Fireman
I got that fire, I'm hollering, I got that fire, come and try me, and

Yeah, don't worry
Don't worry
I'ma put you out'Cause I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
Counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
Yeah, my bitch got a wife
Yeah, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
They pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied
Yeah, bad bitch on my team, mmm
Bad bitch on my team, just like Katniss Everdeen
Got lipstick everywhere
I got her shaking on this dick-dick-dick-dick-dick-dick like a electric chair, lawd
I got liquor, I got cigarettes
And these pussy ass niggas just got PMS
I don't think you should see him, nor live off per diem
She just took off her clothes and said you ain't lyin'
She pretty like the bride of Frankenstein
She kill it like she married to the mob
I can't let one of these hoes lock me down mama
She said don't worry son I'll help you make bond
'Cause these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
Diamonds in my teeth, I'm eating carrot cake
So hard for me to put on a fake smile
I had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
I got cocaine, I got cigarettes
I don't do neither, it's at my bitch request
She like bad boys, I'm her crook in the neck
Her suicide note say she love me to death
Ooh, for her Lewinsky is so critical
And I didn't mean to get political
I watch her, let her figure slither
But I don't look into her snake eyes
I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
They pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet, fat as fuck, with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy but they don't get out of line
I'm sorry for the wait til I drop that Carter 5
'Cause these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "who that?"
Big Bun Beeda but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? 
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix, man, just gon' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand with no easy fix, man 
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar and hoes in the crib
Drank and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with P.A. so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
Said we do it for the Pimp so no holding back, let's go!
Look who crept in, crept-crept in
Look-look who crept in, look-look who
L-l-l-look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB 'til the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants
Like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seem
To get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper
Now it's Chandon, fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight
That my crown ain't for testing, testing
Chop heads off like King Henry the Eighth
Guillotine to your neck, bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wildin' dude
Studied Taoism and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet, seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
But yo, my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate, 'cause like my nigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to niggas"
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta when I pop up with them poppers, burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood, Bl-Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fire
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die, until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed Do-or-Die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company, and Weezy the boss!
They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Hm... Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth
Got 'em sayin' "There he goes again!"
See now, they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
Now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistaking
How I be breakin' up everything
And be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done 
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with "Tha Carter IV"Dedication 6
See, normally this where I'd say
"And like that, we gone"
Ahh, ah, this that 6 shit
Ah, Dedication 6
But really, we just halfway
Dedication 6, ah, ahh
This that 6 shit, ah, Dedication 6
This just part one!
Yah, yah-ahh 
You ain't gotta lie to me
But you might have to lie for me
You might have to trap for me
You know I got mouths to feed
You know they got bitches that'd die to be
The bitch that'll die for me
Strap doves to her body and fly to me
But you get too high to me 
And you don't even believe in Yeezus
Why you wearin' Yeezy sneakers?
She ain't never swallowed semen
I don't even believe her speeches
You can't even keep a secret
Why you wear Victoria Secret
You don't even believe in peace
I'm fuckin' you with both my fingers
Baby I'm out your league, bitch
You know there's no more me's, bitch
You need to show more cleavage
V-neck polo tees, bitch
You need to patch your weave, bitch
You need to pack your things, bitch
You on some "I had a dream" shit
It's back to reality, bitch
She don't even roll the weed
All she do is roll her eyes
All she know is social media
We don't even socialize
I feel like North Korea
Even though we oceanside
All I say is "Mama-mia"
She don't even know her moms
All she say is "This your pussy"
She say that to most of the guys
She don't even know it's dry
I can't even open fire
She don't even close her eyes
She don't even close the blinds
She spit all over the D
I'm sticky like porcupines
She don't even compromise
I still make her cum three times
I still make her snort some lines
And make her look so surprised
I still her make her recognize
Make her exercise to a sexier size
Then I tell her how to tell better lies
Now her extra guys think she never lie
We got a better bond, we have a better time
She got a wetter pond
I cum ahead of time, and a second time
And in record time
I'm a New Orleans nigga, I make a second line
I'm a Megatron
I got her legs up like the Omega sign
And I know she rolling 'cause I checked her tires
Then I checked her eyes, she a little rough around the edges, fine
Like Checkers fries
And the X was mine
She requested five
So I gave her two and told her stretch the high
We had sex 'til nine, ate breakfast tired
Fell asleep eye to eye, thigh on thigh
Then she woke up high, like "Oh my God" and tried to rectify
But if you naked, why?
If you mesmerized be mesmerized
If you scared of love, I'm death-defyin'
Got to make your mind, I'ma make the guap
Got to take your time, I'ma take the shot
I'ma wake the block, I'ma break the lock
Then rape your thot, then shake the spot
I'ma shake your hand when I see you out
I'ma shake my head when you turn around
Cops shake they head when they see your house
We shot it up, but look like we burned it down
Hor-Horror scene, bitch
Everyday Halloween, bitch
Kidnap, hide and seek, bitch
I'm a legend like Socrates, bitch
I aim at your collard green, bitch
Bada-boom, bada-bing, bitch
I'm looking for a solid, clean bitch
I tell her "Look, honestly, bitch"
You ain't gotta lie to me
But you might have to lie for me
You might have to trap for me
You know I got mouths to feed
You know they got bitches that'll die to be
The bitch that'd die for me
Stickin' to a nigga like Siamese
And you just on the side of me
And you don't even like Adidas
Why you wearin' Yeezy sneakers?
She ain't never had a threesome
I dont' even believe her speeches
She don't even believe in freedom
But all she giving me is freebies
You don't even believe in peace
I'm fuckin' her with both my fingers
6 shit

So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
Off of the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost
When I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Leavin' nothin' but mothers stuck and plus a coffin to give
What is happening is a merger, different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cookin' and I'm a server
Further, that's what I'ma get doing this
Remember when eating Gerber
Mama said to kill 'em all and I heard her
Thank you Baby for what became Lil Wayne
He's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name, it's been a change in my lane
I'm a Klusterfuk and lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
Really be bussin' up, they thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up, you in the gang, you bang
You drug and touchin' every thang, you lame
Sucka, you cannot sustain the reign
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Ballin' nigga, Strange Music, crew threw swishes
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, Soo Woo bidness
Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga, "All those flows are borrowed"
It’s the pharaoh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cairo, lookin’ at stars
So bright in the sky, I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those?
AA whole carload, of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender
Please remember, don’t feed the Simba
Three’s assembled like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She’s the only girl that was smart e-nough
To call me 'Mr. Benjamin' in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon; I pound it harder
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones? Well tonight then
We gon’ do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It’s important that you are more than
Welcome to Tha Carter IV and
Y’all enjoy it, I will go ‘head
And I’ll kiss y’all on y’all forehead, outUh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I’m dope, nigga
Change my name, I ain't like average Joe, nigga
Up above wit' my above average ho, nigga
Tight frame with a tight cameltoe, nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killas on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin’ eyebrows
Ooh, kill 'em - It's that "Carter V", let me get 'em
I'm feeling like John Gotti Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin' at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library, nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin’ every winter
And as long as I’m alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I’m not a broke nigga
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin’, you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, "You are what you smoke"
I grew up around dope niggas
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas
I grew up around dope niggas
Yeah, I grew up around dope niggas and cold killers
And most niggas was both, nigga, two sport niggas
I was no different from those niggas, but I was chose, nigga
See those niggas somewhere with me in these hoes, nigga
Momma was a go-getter, a coach, nigga
Taught me everything I know, nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goal tender, support system
For that bitch, you played her role with ya and those children
I ain't lyin', slime, all my niggas balling, it's a fuckin' team sport
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote
All my niggas balling, that's how it's supposed to be, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode
Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga, get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people
And definitions 'cause we're defined by our legal roles
All your haters fuelin', my needle broke
Lord, I ain't a broke nigga
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin', you a customer

I thank the Lord I ain't a broke niggaWhere's my coffee?
Good morning, Dr. Carter 
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Ahh, another one huh? What we got
Your first patient 
Is suffering from a lack of concepts 
Originality 
His flow is weak 
And he has no style 
What you got for him? 
Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue
Excuse me if I'm late, but like a thief it takes
Time to be this great, uhh, so just wait
Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place
And I'm just grace, one, uno, ace
And I'm trying make your heart beat like bass
Hmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix wherever your shell break
Where is your originality? You are so fake
So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like, hey! Brighter than a sun ray
Got a pistol on a playground, watch the gun-play
Like, no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday, gotta not be cliché
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei
You gotta have faith, you gottta, gotta
Wait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him
Good afternoon, Dr. Carter 
I don't know about this one. His confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work, and he lacks respect for the game
You think you can save him?
Okay, respect is in the heart, so that's where I'mma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
But, hey kid, plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling, r-e-reciting something
'Cause you just like it, so you say it just like it
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing, now I'm like lightning
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan
Fast and exciting, my passion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your IV
Here, take this Vicodin, like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind, I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it, and I'm in the emergency un-it
God dunnit I've lost another one
Good evening, Dr. Carter. It's been a long day. But this one looks much better than the others. His respect is back up, concepts sound good, his style is showing strong signs of improvement. All he needs now is his swagger
Okay, let me take my gloves off then
Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly, go hard, like geese, erection
Fashion patrol, police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese Connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby, don't get me wrong, I could do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to write, too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice, swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast, I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
That swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow, his blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow, this one's starting to show
Strong signs of life, where's the stitches? Here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply "What a night"
"Welcome back, Hip-Hop — I saved your life"
He looks good, his vitals are up
He's looking good, he's looking good
I think we got one, Dr. Carter, I think we got one
Yep, yep, we got one, we saved him he's good
He's good, we got one, he's good
He's good, we got him

And my hoes say I'm amazing, but I don't listen to a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot, and I say "No bitch, I'm blazing"

I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doing time
I goes crazy inside, but when it comes out—it's fine

The bottles, the battles, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita—I love you, Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat ya?
'Member when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver?

If lovin' me is wrong, I don’t wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I’m never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix
Off button, pause button, stop button, lock button
Belly button, big ol' titties, she pop buttons, head buttin'

Rest in peace, I rest in peace and harmony
I don't talk, I speak, after I pray, I preach

The fork in the road, grab the fork and eat
Turn that piggy bank to some hog head cheese
But you doin' nothing, well they say, "Nothin' ain't never worth nothin', but it's always free"
Psychopath
Blunt thick, thick as Mama June off the diet plan, smokin' science lab

I'm never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrixWe are at war with the universe
The sky is falling and the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da, ooohh
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down
Yeah, some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometimes that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn
I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low
No one's gonna save us now
How you feel you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome, no
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?
I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around, the luck's all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right
And I'mma tell you what's life, and did you know
I lost everything? But I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They tryna tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floating
And they wonder why black people still voting
Cause your president still choking
Take away the football team, the basketball team
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
Let's pray
These friends they come and go
But I got family, family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go
That there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low
And we can't overcome, no
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?
Yeah, and if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process is so much stress
But it's the progress that feels the best
Cause I came from the projects straight to success, and you're next
So try, they can't steal your pride, it's inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud, there's a silver lining, I know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
See right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark
We ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart
We need love
That's all y'all, that's all
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?
Yeah, born right here in the USA
But due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So accept my emotion
Do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul and I must be me
We got spirit y'all, we got spirit
We got soul y'all, we got soul
They don't want us to see, but we already knowI can't fuck with ho niggas, I can't trust these hoes neither

And if you shootin' for the stars then just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach Mars
Paws, claws, because, I'm a beast, I'm a dog

I'm flying, I'm higher
And I've done it before
Please don't make me do it no more

Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian, or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction
She looked me in my eyes and said
Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I said shorty, you a beast
I love bad bitches, okay, what's the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up then I'mma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housing

And if you talk trash I'mma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi
I heard 'em tell me "Go get 'em, young"
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag 
And all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prolly gon' bruise"
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
That sick shit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide em
Can't live with em, Can't live without em
Can't trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a fuckin problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me
I ain't looking for a lady, call Will Smith to get you hitched
I ain't looking for a wife, I need a one night trick
That can ride it like that, suck it like this
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip
I'm a mac, I'm a pimp girl
You don't need make up, put this mac on your lips
She drive a X5, beefin' with her ex man
Baby Ima dog and a DMX fan
Told myself I wouldn't mess with my ex again
Popped a lil x then i tried explain

We treat that pussy like some good weed and pass that

Bought some bitches, and she was wit' it
With you she wasn't, but she did it
She let you lick it, but never stick it
You be trippin, you say you fallin
Nigga you slippin, stupid ass nigga tryna' fall in love
If i fall it's gon be from too many drugs
You asking questions, bout what she was
With the rider game, she told you in the clubMan all you pussy niggas drive me crazy
Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building
I could still taste her pussy, memorabilia
Backpack full of artillery, one me, no equivalent
These niggas acting like lil bitches
I don’t understand this shit like you scribbled it
Took her clothes, step back and exhibit it
Then tear her ass up like a parking ticket
The end of the road is at walking distance
Have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision
My weed man so consistent
I’m stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions
Everything I do I plan it out like a solar system
Nigga if you clumsy you gon slip and fall a victim to me
Your bitch is sendin' naked pictures to me
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in a bed
I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet uh
Skatin on em like I’m Lil Wayne
And the weed so strong I can feel veins
Write it down, take a picture, now I feel framed
The drugs got me so numb I can’t feel ashamed
And my girl at home with the mood swings
Girl I gotta make a few runs like Usain
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change
Hungry niggas going at yo neck for that food chain
Pop some pills that make me sleepy
Hoes creep me in they Teepee
I hope that pussy taste like kiwi
Hope it’s nicer than Tahiti, hopin I could get a freebie
Leavin a nigga body floatin with a mouth full of seaweed
What's in my Louis backpack, that’s E.T
Snitches give me the heebeegeebees
I hope they’ll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo back
I’mma yell timber, money grow on trees
Money over queens, fuck you blow me
I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please
I don’t really do shit but sit back and call the shots
She poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks
Red beam on yo head, that’s a cherry on top
You don’t wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that’ll die uh
I danced with the devil in my dreams
When I wake up I still hear the same song
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out
Flood warning nigga, I’m about to brainstorm, lil nigga

Pass that weed around, like that shit contagious
And I got news for all these snitches, tell them feds stop bitchin'
If pussy lips could talk, I'd go down there like it's whisperin'
You know life is so uncertain and death is so unwanted
My navigation system say, "It's death around the corner"
I got a condo for a stash house, a condo for a stash house
Get that boy a mirror, so he can watch his damn mouth
See I get it from Sosa, he got it from Frank
And Sosa alright, but I'm tryin' to meet Frank
He said business is well, he ain't got no complaints
You'll be Batman and I'll be robbin' the bank
I know I ain't gon' fall, even though I'm power trippin'
Glass house nigga, you see how I'm livin'
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new age
Ain't no such thing as too paid

AK wet niggas up, I don't throw water balloons
Better call the platoon
If it's fuck it then fuck it, now you speakin' my language
Put your dead body under them white sheets with no blankets
I'm so rich I go pour
Champagne and don't drink it
Ice on my neck like I fainted
These are the thoughts of the brainless
No new friends, we don't talk to strangers
Man I'm so serious with this pimp shit
Full clip in my Mac 10
Ain't no exit out the game, nigga cut off your blinkers
And if she married I fuck her, if she lonely I fuck her
If she crazy I love her, y'all just don't understand her
She say you got it made, I say no I got a butler
They tell me to turn up, but I'm the knob on the oven
I got a knife in my pocket if there's a fork in the road
I'm the man of steel, but I won't say what I stole
Bring that coke to the stove, and whip it like a new slave
Whip it like a new slave

Take that coke to the stove
And whip it like a new slave, whip it like a new slave
Like it's freezing and you naked shake that ass hoSee we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking

She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"

I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool
And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
Cause every time she try to tell me something, she open up her mouth, I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina, a skirt with nothing under
And she say when she don't see me, she feels like Stevie Wonder
That's when I said, "Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times

Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse

Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne
Make him change his name to John Doe
It's me and my lil brother Capo
Lil Marly G and my bottom bitch
If I'm falling, it's bottomless
If I'm tripping, it's a power trip
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates
And with that said, I climb the fence
My other bitches gotta ride the bench
And with that said... bitch you jealous
I'm fly like my dreadlocks propellers
I think I should headline Coachella
My woman a Queen like Coretta
And nigga you sleep with the Devil
I couldn't be Junior forever
I don't mean to ruffle your feathers
But I had to spread my wings
Ain't trying to get lemon-peppered
Got too many pistols, too many issues
Too many mistakes, too many miscues
Only made me better, it turned me into
The man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just coming in
Like I broke a window to an igloo
Slow a bitch down like "Un momento"
I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie
If she ain't fucking it's Uber time
I'd rather be advised than supervised
You do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine
In water guns and shoot each other
I get high, meditate like a monk
Preposterous when I get drunk
And my goons is wilder than Gronk
My do's is as bad as my don'ts
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk
As long as the bitch got a donk
And I smell like; pussy, money, and weed
She say "Ooh, I like your cologne"
The last niggas tested us flunk
So please study hard, study long
Kill your wife, then take the bitch phone
And text you to please hurry home
And the rain drops turn into blood
Look like you just come in from a storm
And if all pussies come with walls
I hope you run into your own
Nigga
I come with that heroin flow
I come with that never before
My CMB days are dead
I ain't worried 'bout ghost
I married the MOB, we divorced
Hoo, and all that shit dead without me of course
It's nothing; a zombie, a corpse
You burnt yourself and was supposed to pass me the torch
Fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes, nigga

In the heart of the summer, we need a snowplow
What you know about that? Baby, it's your time
Coke transactions on the phone, we call it "blowjobs" 
Too fast for the feds, too cocky for the cops
Had to ditch my old bitch
Getting sloppy with the pots 
Hopping off the boat, meeting Papi at the docks 
He tell me I'm gaining weight, I tell him I'm getting paid 
"Money over bitches," I'm yelling it to the grave
Developed at a young age , go after what pays 
These Gabbana sunshades block the Sun rays 
I drop a car note in the mall on the first date 
I gotta get it even if it's in the worst way 
That cake, like it's—it's my birthday
New Orleans my birthplace, you heard me?
Where money's more important than a person, nigga!

Twisting up a blunt, thinking 'bout my next dollar 
I'm digging in the game tryna get some money out her 
I'm so vain, it's a problem 
There ain't a stain on these Pradas 
I'm just being modest 
Got me a goddess, show her how to divide it 
She still down, and she don't get none of the profit 
Wheel 'round the city, let the tints hide me
"That's a cold motherfucker, whoever inside it" 
Forever symbolizing the grind, it don't walk to you
I make it run like horses do 
Giddy-up, baby, if he got it, then hit him up, baby 
I know it's crazy, but I can't get enough, baby 
I love it, I fucking love it
I'm a self-made millionaire, fuck the public

Pistol on my lap, on the way to the money!

The money turned my niggas into monsters
The white done turned my niggas into Nazis, Lord
The money turned my face into a stocking
Don't make me turn your baby to a hostage, boy
Don't make me turn the kid to a foster
My woman turn my dick into a Mazda, Lord
Body parts in the duffel
The bullets turn your body to a puzzle
The money turn my bitch into a monster
She know how to get a check and turn a zero to a comma, Lord
The money turn my niggas into killas
The sugar turnt the cocaine to vanilla
The money turnt the bitches into hoes
The money turned my niggas into foes, Lord
I put my shooters on they feet
Give 'em your address, then I go out to eat
Had that snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze
She from the hood but look like she from overseas
I said, "Girl you know I love you and I care for ya
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya"
She say, "Fuck these other niggas, they ain't half of ya
Just keep laughing to the bank, it's hilarious"
I got a stay-at-home gun and a travel gun
Boy, we could sell white, in Africa
It's like, I can't explain, y'all asked me to spit
And now I'm drooling on my chain
"What happened to Wayne?"
I'm like, hold up, wait a second, y'all thought I was second?
Hating on a champ, throwing salt and not confetti
We pull up and we shoot, then we park the car and edit
Watch me pull up with no roof
Tthat's cause I walk the dog and pet it
I'm like, hold up, wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
Shoot you in your head, then just walk off like I didn't
Let my money talk so much, put my jawbone outta business
Doing numbers in this bitch, I'm like a smart phone with the digits
Bitch!
Riding 'round with the volume down
With the windows up and the choppers down
Soon as we get to your block
It's the motherfuckin' other way around
My bitch say I'm too wild
She don't even know why she stay around
I get home and I dick her down
Now she talking 'bout exchanging vows
If these bullets was paintballs
I could fuck around and I could paint a house
You could tell I'm pimpin'
Tthe way I hit the blunt with my pinkie out
I bring wine to Amy house
We smoke it out and we drank it out
And talk about these pussy niggas
Tthat ain't about what Wayne about
I'm hangin out a Mulsanne without a brain, it's out of its mind
I pull over, I push a button, it change like Optimus Prime
Speaking of change, it's a shame how these lames droppin' them dimes
We aim at your grape, knock it off, now you just vines
Blood Gang, red rain on these niggas, hot if you dry
My gang top of the line, hollerin' out "Squad, take it outside"
I'm a taxpayer, I'm a axe player, gettin' in through the back well
Red devil to the blue collared, un-enveloped blackmail
Fed up with the fed shit and Fed-Ex lost my package
My white girls say "Yeah, nigga!" My white homies act blackish
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL
Should've  been in N.W.A., fuck the police, Five-0 and 12
One time for your mind, bitch, never say "Nevermind," bitch
You a penny short of a dime, bitch, no nonsense
Had a nine since I was nine, bitch
Yeah, born to murder
Bank account on fat, bustin' out the girdle
Tell 'em boys ain't nothin' sweet, it's sauerkraut, ya heard me?
They find ya body in New Orleans on Mardi Gras on Bourbon
Like, oh, Lord, Humphrey Bogart
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a crowbar
For the most part, I'm the southern coast guard
AK-47 spittin' flame like a blow torch

I just had to get me set, and I'm not playin' skip recess
I'm a different Weezy, and I'm drippin' Fiji
In a Lamborghini with the seats wet
Hardest lesson is regret
Snorting powder on the P jet
Ask the pilot are we there yet
He said we on the ground, and we ain't leave yet
Had to step back and take a deep breath
It's hard as heck to show 'em respect
I love 'em to death but they ain't dead yet
Don't know how long I'm able to repeat that
Me I'm just tryin' to see the bread stretch
These niggas tryna see dread stress
Me, I'm just tryin' to see the dead rest

Watch the women wave cause I'm freakin' gnarly
Percs and purp got me sleepin' calmly
So I wake up and I chase the check

But we gon win, and I promise that

Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like "let's play," lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song

I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef

I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho
God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We went from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side

Life is a midget, so try to live it up
It's Dr. Carter, bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up

Yeah, big money nigga
Big money nigga, big money nigga
Yeah, and you ain't got nothin' on meTwo shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser
Goons in this bitch, leave a nigga on a stretcher
It's all there papa, you ain't even got to measure
Laughing at how my old bitches look jealous
Well what goes around comes around, propellers
Money Over Bitches, M.O.B, goodfellas
Cut our ears off, ain't shit you could tell us
Write your name on the bullet, that's a fuckin' love letter
If I ain't a trendin' topic, I'm a fuckin' trend-setter, I'm on
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
Man, it's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser
If you're scared, go to church, Mason Betha
Sometimes the paper chase could be like chasin' a leopard
The pussy wetter, wetter than it's ever been
But she gone probably try to cross the line like a Mexican
I ain't on that bullshit, shorty fine as fuck though
Now she kiss me on my neck, I hope she ain't cut-throat
Cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow
Shoot so many times I'mma choke off the gunsmoke
Life, death, love, hate, pleasure, pain
Pay me no mind but I don't have change
I cock back and aim at your membrane
Broad day, no mask, close range
You can get two shots from wherever, two shots from whoever
It be like a puzzle tryna put you back together
I should probably do better but probably, whatever
Your bullshit is stinkin' up the place
Me no tek bad up, me a done de place
Can't let these bitch niggas slide and touch base
I make her cum so many times, call her "nutcase"
It's Young Money baby, take your clothes off
Give me them three holes, bowlin' ball
Two shots of whatever
Keep them bitches cummin' and she gon' do whatever
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whateverDead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It was worse than dead, his brain is gone

He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
Dead man walkin', through a dead plant garden
Red ants army, Caveman Spartan
Die, come back to life, shaved and corporate
I paved and carved it, made man forfeit
Laid and chalked him, I slaved then bossed it
I don't need flowers around my grave, I need maids and doormen
We not one and the same;
Casper the Friendly, Tunechi Cobain
Ask how I'm livin'? I can't complain
Like, it's hot in hell, but it never rain
Shit never sweet, him never changed
I'll always be the MF'er Wayne
I been lost conscious, I never regain
Bitches wanna sleep with my remains, lawd
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I just double parked the hearse by a fire hydrant
They throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy
Gone but not forgotten, no
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name

He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
Dead man walkin', the weed I'm sparkin'
Stank like corpses, got a young nigga coughin'
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin
Bad bitches in my coffin, suck dick 'til they cough
How long will they mourn me?
I had a Rolls Royce Ghost
Now I'm feelin' like that motherfucka comin' back to haunt me
We are not one and the same;
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked
So fuck every key on your key chain, boy
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin', Lord, I'm undecided
Throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten
 I never see your crazy face 
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I never see your crazy face 
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that

He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It's worse than dead, his brain is goneWhen this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us
Love only lasts if my heart races on
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yea, on
I'm racing on, yea
My heart races on
I'm priceless
Remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me, and continue to bite me
Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Lord, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my momma, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side
Where the flowers never die
The angels never lie
Yeah, the revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized
Lord, Momma hate I got my Daddy’s eyes
Never looked into my Daddy’s eyes
He ain't have the time
Fuck him
The revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized

Tunechi, you an angel
Must be here for a reason, and that might be the main one
Fuck it, I'm making money before making changes
I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it, then exchanged it
Fuck it, I'm working bitch, I know you see me working
Searching for better days before a better person
I'm perfect
Just ask my bitch and she’ll say that so urgent
I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah
My heart right, and my head ain't
'Cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think
And I grew wings

Life is just a race against time so have a good time
Heart racing, thoughts racing
Competition, goodbye
I turn around and run backwards
To see what second place look like

Stare into the eyes, the eyes of forever
Hear no evil see no evil, Helen Keller
No music on, rock it acapella

Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward, I race a NASCAR
Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out
Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange Mound, letdown, I lay her down
Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my madhouse open and my lighthouse glowin'
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy
Brains all over my mahogany dashboard
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
I think in my backyard, I need an airport
Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin, touch me, I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh-oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Fab Five
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fucking Arabi, it's no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany headboards
Oh, woah, mahogany, yeah, woah
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Uh, yeah, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy

It's a war in these streets, I need a Humvee
That AK-47, that's my trusty
Got some tricks up my sleeves, I need some cufflinks
Oh Lord, these niggas soft, these niggas fluffy
Another one bites the dust 'til his gums bleed
Oh Lord, Public Enemy, Chuck D
Me with no money's like a bunny with no front teeth
Fuck me? It's fuck you if it's fuck me
I hit the kush, blow it out like a bum knee
Where the haters? Point 'em out and ask 'em what's beef
Stack of hundred dollar bills in a scrunchie
Oh Lord, kamikaze, kidnappin' killers
Screaming "Fuck the other side!"
She ride the dick, the dick gon' kill her, vehicular homicide
Oh Lord, I'm Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga
I'm sorry for them other guys
Lay a nigga down, Nina sang his ass a lullaby
Wave your white flag all you want, bitch, I'm colorblind
Bad bitch with me got thunder thighs and her mother's eyes
Li-li-li-lick my lollipop like it got gum inside
Miami in the winter, Cali in the summertime
My bitch is independent, she don't ask me for a dime
Love it when we makin' love, hate it when it's fuckin' time
Disrespect the caterpillar, rave about the butterfly
Bullet ain't got no name, nigga, but you could get it customized
Run up in your house, undisguised, why you look surprised?
Motherfuckers better fuckin' hide, I feel like Mr. Hyde
Athletes still gettin' jacked like they missin' tires
Oh Lord, one of the wildest B's in my hive
I'll sting a bitch and die anytime
Hate it when the fuckin' police shut the session down
We just talkin', we just skatin', we just messin' round
Tell them niggas that be hatin' we ain't messin' round
They just barkin', they just fakin', they gon' settle down
We got bitches, we got beer, we got Bobby Brown
Skatin' underneath the bridge, dead body found
Do a trick over the body, hope he smilin' down
Do a trick off of some stairs, land on solid ground
Grizzly Gang in this bitch, check the grip tape
Nigga came on your bitch, ooh milkshake
Chop a cocaine brick like a sensei
Break the great white down to a fish plate
Woo! Pockets on inflate
Got the Yay locked down like Kim K
I been sippin' codeine since 10K
I be cussin' while I'm bustin', "Die motherfuckers"
Oh Lord
Get rid of the residue
Get rid of all the white, like Selsun Blue
It's that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I'm so sorry, I feel terrible
Yeah, I know I keep on telling youI got Young Money up, and now I got my feet up
Tune in this bitch, tell my niggas throw them B's up
Doing what the fuck I want, hate me all the fuck you want
Real niggas fuck with me and I don't give a fuck who don't
Lock the CEO up, and I'm the CEO, fuck
Prison in February, and I ain't in no rush
Drink 'til I throw up, nigga, roll more blunts
Ball so hard, man, I gotta go pro once
Hit 'em with the shotgun, call that shit the stop button
Call me Doctor Carter, AKA "Young Wild Nigga"
AKA "No Trial Nigga", AK click-clack, pow nigga
Fucking with the kid and you'll be missing like Bilal, nigga
Yeah! Swagger stupid, pack a Uzi
Hundred clips, nigga? That's a movie, aim at your toupee
You sweet as Kool-Aid, creme brulee
I'm sharp as Blu-ray, I fuck her today
Then she gotta skate — Young Lupe
I hit the beat hard — Bobby Boucher
I keep them tools on me, get the screwface
Flowers for the dead, here's a bouquet
L.V.'s, nigga, on every suitcase
Y.M., nigga, it's a new day
We the champions, nigga, hoo-ray
Yeah, hammer in the Louis duff
Take a nigga bitch, she gave me brains until I knew enough
Bullet come too fast to adjust
I don't give a fuck about my roof that much
So I put it in the trunk and then the coupe sped up
Take the chopper out the trunk and just shoot that up
I'm Weezy F and the 'F' is for Flame
Eat these rappers, chef of the game
Shit on the track, shit on the train
Murder the beat, the beat was slain
Rest in peace, that's a shame, he kill anybody's song
Versatile as fuck, I switch it up like Dennis Rodman's dome
No homo, you rockin' wrong, rest in peace my styrofoam
Now they wanna know what I be on
Get the fuck off my dick, my cock, my bone
Big money, my pockets long
New Orleans, I got my home
And they got my back, pause; no homo, no maricón
Smoking on that private grown, it put me where I belong
All about my cheese; cheddar, mozzarella, provolone
Fuck her for an hour long, let her take a shower, gone
Sorry baby, but I'm in my I-don't-wanna-be-bothered zone
Yeah, you're a groupie, get on your duty
Two women give me head, call that "Two-face"
Bitch I'm too great, take your food tray, I was born on doomsday
Ain't no nigga like me
"What's up" to my gang, big B's like a Breitling
Take a nigga bitch, she ride my dick like she cycling
Then she can't walk, run, or jump, like white men
Fuck you niggas wanna do?
No Ceilings, let the bullets rain on you
Weezy F, the 'F' is for "Fuck what you’re goin' through"
Make your people mourn you

Tiffany and Emily, my bonafide sluts
When I cum, they touch tongues and share that nut
Got a white chick down in Florida named Sasha
On my momma, her head golden like an Oscar
And I met her through Tasha
At the condo she let me fuck her on the washer
September nigga, so you know he nasty
And if she nasty, we do the nasty
Now, I tell a bitch like this
You gotta take 10 dicks before you meet the president
Young Money!
I know this one honey
I call her track star, cause when we fuck she run from me
And I'm hella fly, and her dude dumb-bummy
And I don't get girls, I make her get one for me
My weed real plummy, and real gummy
And my flow is harder than an anvil, honey
Shoot these niggas with the handheld, honey
I paper chase, fuck standstill money
Niggas kill with me and kill for me
Best believe we ridin' if the fan belt runnin'
Leave a mothafucker just layin' there bloody
I'm from the dirty and I make it rain, damn, that's muddy
She just wanna be my cuddy buddy
And on these tracks I go nutty-butty
What it dizzoo, is you or is you ain't my baby?
Baby?I-I-I, am-am not a human being!
Uhh, pussy for lunch
Pop all the balloons and spit in the punch, haha
Yeah, kush in the blunts
I ride through your block, see a foot in the trunk
I don't know why they keep playing, they better re-plan
I'm giving 'em the blues, Bobby Blue Bland
Together we stand, and fall on y'all
Balling with my Bloods, call it B-ball
These dames ain't shit, Young Money is
I got Mars bars, 3 Musketeers
Come through, coupe same color as veneers
And you know I'm riding with the toast, cheers
Yeah, now I'm back on my grizz
And y'all's a bunch a squares like a mothafuckin' grid
Shit, fuck with me and get hid
I finger-fuck the Nina, make that bitch have kids
Just do it? My nigga, I just did
Ain't a motherfucker deeper than me, bitch, dig
You dig? This here, this big biz
And I scream, "Fuck it!" Whoever it is
I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I thank God that I am not basic
Oww! I-I am not basic
I-I-I, am-am not a human being!
Uhh, rockstar baby
Now come to my suite and get lockjaw baby
Rich nigga looking at the cops all crazy
That's that mob shit, nigga, Martin Scorsese
Heater close range, cause people are strange
But I bet that AK-47 keep you ordained
You can't see Weezy nor Wayne, I'm in the far lane
I'm running this shit, hundred yard gain
Uhh, swag on infinity
I'm killing 'em, see the white flag from the enemy
Shoot you in your head and leave your dash full of memories
Father forgive me for my brash delivery
I-I-I would try you, I wouldn't lie dude
I must be sticky cause them bitches got their eyes glued
Young Money, baby, we the shit, like fly food
Y'all can't see us, like the bride's shoes
I stand tall like I'm motherfucking 9'2"
I scream "Motherfuck you and whoever designed you!"
And if you think you hot then obviously you were lied to
And we don't die, we multiply, and then we come divide you
I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I thank God that I am not basic
I am not basic
I-I am not basic
I thank God that I am not basic
I-I-I, am-am not a human being!
Re-re-re-re-reporting from another world
Magazine full of bullets, you can be my cover girl
Bless got the weed rolling thicker than a Southern girl
Strong-arm rap like a nigga did a hundred curls
Rockstar biatch, check out how we rock
And if this ain't hip-hop, it must be knee-hop
I'm higher than a tree top, she lick my lollipop
I still get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Spitting that heat rock, I'm smooth, not Pete Rock
And my, and my money on et cetera, three dots
Still get a stomach ache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker, cause we not
You better run 'til your feet stop
You ain't even a fucking alphabet in my teapot
Colder than a ski shop, holding on to the top
And even if I let go, I still won't d-rop
I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I thank God that I am not basic
I-I-I-I, I, I am not
I-I-I, am-am not a human beingI want to be the best
I want to be the best, simple and plain
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
And that's what drives me
He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassin's mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant
There is no one
This guy is highly motivated
What separates Kobe from the pack
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one
Kobe doin' work
2-4 on my shirt
He the greatest on the court
And I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the fourth ring like it was his first
Gotta get the bling
Do it for Kareem
Two-four so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldstein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings
Kobe in the game dunkin' on the whole team
Black Mamba, attack, conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, a turnaround jumper
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's goin', it's goin' down yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show
I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing
Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry 'bout my shot
Cause I'ma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work 'em like a auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with three seconds
And I bet we gon' win it all in three seconds
Ya dig
That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let 'em get to me
Literally
Step back and give 'em a three
Ain't no defending me
One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately, LeBron James
I've been quoted saying that
He's definitely the best player in our league
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our league
And there's not another guy in our league
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing
Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline face time
Tongue out like two-three
Even two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha brackets ain't for me
I will be jumpin' over you
Like I got a mattress at my feet
And all the Phil Jackson say teams
Better be passin' it to me
I put the master in the piece
Attack you like a beast
I am starvin' for victory
And that means I'mma eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me
Seckbach: Who's the best player in the NBA
Mikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant
Seckback: Really? Why
Mikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get!
Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. Automatic
I can post 'em up, or Lamar go get the alley
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want
They want Kobe
And what he want
He want the trophy
The victory
And the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break 'em off, Kobe break 'em off, yeah
You better be where that Laker don't, yeah
Just give him the ball and he take it off, yeah
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol, yeah
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah
Uh, do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothin' wrong with doin' it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin
Killer instinct
Murder the basket
Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a all-star, been a champion
Free throw line, you hear 'em chanting
MVP, MVP
Kobe Bryant aka Envy Me
In knee deep, smash any D
Whoever he is he can't guard me
He can't guard me
"So, there you have it. The overwhelming answer was ... Kobe Bryant"Livin'!
Nigga, that's me in that nice-ass house
Butt-naked bitch with a nice ass
Walking 'round saying "You got a nice-ass house!"
My phone keep ringing though, my bad
I think my girl got me on spy cam now
My homies call cocaine "White trash"
Charge you double just to take my trash out
I cannot fuck wit' you bitch, 'cause you gon' get a nigga busted
Worrying 'bout the wrong things while I'm hustlin'
Put the dick up in your mouth while it's runnin'
Bitch, don't ask no questions
Soon as I heard this a young nigga killed it
'Cause I go too hard, I eat beats, mmm, scrumptious, delicious
Shoot you in your kidneys
I hope you see blood when you pissin'
We run up in your house on Christmas
And don't ask no questions
Just shoot whoever's present
While they open their presents
Oh please, Lord, forgive me
I just talked to my Reverend
Asked him if I'm the Devil
He said "That's these bitches"
See, I'm from New Orleans
That bitch is infested
Shootouts like the Westerns
Kill you and your bestie
Pay niggas to do it correctly
Two Ninas, they lesbians
I gotta shoot you with both or else one'd get jealous
I make money, not exceptions
Take pills like breath mints
She just get dick and refreshments

Standing on the top, I got a
Lot of observations
Young nigga, lot of options

Runnin' through a check
Buyin' all the champagne
Blowin' up the net
And settin' all the trends
Showin' niggas what’s next
I was drinkin' coffee
Smokin' weed on the jet
Probably wit' your wifey
In the back for pillow talk
But we ain’t talkin'
Gettin' top while ain't no top
Swear to God I had a chopper
Now the gun biz are the friends hoppin' out a helicopter
I be rollin' up the Doctor’s wishes
Countin' up the money, kickin' out the bitches
'Cause they all up on you, but be gone when it get real
Bitches ain’t shit but a brick through your windshield
Shows in the evening
Business meetings in the morning
Goons on deck, don't make a nigga sick 'em on ya
Niggas talkin' shit
Gon' make a nigga get pneumonia
Wrist so cold
Think it’s sick and got Ebola
Crib so big
Got a bitch in every corner
Joint smoke good

In the morning I got meetings with my lawyer
Arguments I’ll never be a part of
Love pussy and some good conversation
And that money, we'll  never see a shortage
Nigga run up on me, he gon' be a goner
Bruce Wayne whip

Red bandana in my right pocket
So if I pull the trigger I can wipe that down
I just put my gun up in her Coach bag
I won’t hesitate to pull it right back out
Life coach? I don’t need no life coach
To coach me through my motherfuckin' ups and downs
Tell a bitch "Don’t ask no questions"
My money so old
I tell my new money "Respect your elders"
I’m startn' to get jealous
Of my own reflection
The young nigga sexy
A young nigga healthy
A young nigga flexin'
I’m countin' my blessin's
"Achoo," "God bless me"
"Thank you," "You welcome"
I talked to my Reverend
Asked him if there’s a Heaven
A Heaven for a G, because me and my Gangstas
Done done it all, but never tell
He say “We already in Hell”
I say “Ain’t that a bitch”
'Cause I work too hard, but still thankful as if

And boy, my hoes don't get in line because they stay in line
I'm shining on these hoes so hard they getting tan lines

Dirty money, no footprints in dirt
We geeked up, the revenge of the nerds
I swear, play with these niggas, that's that shit I don't do
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food
I got the power, but a short fuse, let's go

You know snitches get stitches, nigga, needle and thread

Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his
I feel like He-Man when I'm in your ho
And tell that bitch give me my space, like a telescope
In her throat like Ricola, my system solar

Watch that nigga, let's go
Boy, my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians
Straight blowing money fast, I'mma get a ticket
Soon as I get off paper, I'mma smack a nigga
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke
Right back pocket, flag redder than a velvet rope
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's telling jokes
I swear to God, I put in work
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert
I spit these bars, this a uni-verse
You better duck, like Dooney and Bourke
I'm telling ya, shout out Turk
It's Hot Boys, bitch, the block is hot
If I ain't have the keys to success I would have picked the lock
Diarrhea, shit don't stop, until my fucking casket drop
Still got that crack, maybe one day I'mma pass the rock
Tunechi

Close his casket, he look deformed
I got bitches on my dick
I got Jays at my door
I got shooters on my team

Counting money, dirty and clean
Smoking nothing but Irene

You do you, I'mma do what it do
Niggas dropping dimes and their 2 cents too

Fucking with you it's a new excuse

All my goons be too enthused
So don't open your mouth, like you're chewing glue
Light blue Michael Jordans
My shoe get checks like "Swoosh"
Hear you niggas talking about what you gon' do
Or might do, I invite you, I entice you but I advise you
Not to, God bless you like "Achoo"
Police find you in the bayou
With your friends by you
And your shit knocked loose

Shifty eyes, I see four, flip them pies like D. Dawes

What am I waiting for?Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror,, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
I see the fire in his eyes
But he keep my blood temperature zero
Man in the mirror, my 'migo
Crème de la crème de la Créole
Couple a cracks in the mirror
Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though
Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
Yeah It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Man in the mirror, my hero
He got me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
It's written all over my face
Tattoos that can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaksHahaha 
C5, D-Block, L-O-X
You know?
Yeah, yeah
Say the judge or the jury can't spoil this
Nah, two thirds of the world's most loyalest
I'ma shoot em, I'ma pay the bail, I'm sure of this
I'ma kill em, I'ma get the witness, teach 'em more of this
We never sing, not even on a song, where the chorus is
Dig the hole, get the wood box, bring the florist in
Tell the pastor, tell the family, we was just warnin' them
38's, 45's, all type of Tauruses
About to hit the bong, pour the Holy water in
Celebrating', for participatin', in the slaughterin'
Eatin' steaks at the same spot, they killed Paulie in
Frank White's three in the quarter, tapin' your daughter in
Columbia with the connect, puttin' the order in
Nigga act, we gon' clap, like we the audience
Make sure you wipe down the strap, get rid of all the prints
Do your homework on, whoever you go to war against
I had 20s on my Benz, lend it to all my friends
And everything was all gravy, everything was all gravy
And if I need somethin' call Baby, I need something call Baby
And the streets was callin' me, but a nigga had call waitin'
And yeah we all went through our phases, we all went through our savings
Some niggas stayed on point, some niggas was point shavin'
And sometimes we had to be vegetables
That mean we had to stay patient, 'cause they say you are what you eat
I took the star out of starvation, bitch
I come from a Third World, started rappin' in the fourth grade
Started trappin' in the sixth grade, went platinum in the tenth grade
Dropped out, a nigga gettin' paid, this when Birdman had a fade
This when Hummers didn't come stretch, but Birdman had 'em made
This when pretty bitches set you up, and niggas didn't give two fucks
You had two guns and two phones, you could waste time and get a new cup
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and new rappers got hemmed up
And all them niggas that's bitin' got they fins cut
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, "That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, "That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"
And we gon' be around 'til yo motherfuckin' body rot
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
Uh
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and dirty money got rinsed up
And the early birds in the wormhole would get so fat that they'd get stuck
We'd clean our fingerprints up, we'd clean the shit we didn't touch
This when niggas called Diddy Puff, lettin' Biggie bump
While I'm sittin' up in that big body, I can show you a dead body
Lotta niggas got pinched, and the snitches ended up dead lobsters
Wrap the birds in red tape, call them bitches Red Robins
Pops had kilos, I needed one ki I would've made copies
Free my niggas down and Rest In Peace to all my dead partners
I smoke 'bout a pound in like a week, and fuck the Weight Watchers
Got my self a brand new triple beam, just to weigh options
I stumbled upon a gold mine, I thank God that it ain't copper
Some niggas were late bloomers, but, boy, look how they've blossomed
Don't know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go haywire
I know hoes that play possum, and will bring us to y'all mailboxes
And dead man can't talk and the Feds don't have séances
Look, you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her pussy
And get through customs, 'cause last time we just took em
I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin'
And you can beat around the bush and find a nigga layin' behind them bushes
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, "That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like, "That's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"
And we gon' be around 'til yo motherfuckin' body rot
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in, we get the same time Gotti got

I fell asleep in it like Whitney
I go hard for my baby
Psycho ward for my baby
Swipe that card for my baby
Body guard for my baby
Bobby Brown for my baby
Lock it down for my baby
I knock that pussy out
And then I growl for my baby
Even psycho's need love too
I save all her text messages
I smell her panties while she in the bathroom
And taste whatever she left in them
I take pictures of her when she not lookin'
Study 'em microscopically
Marry me and then bury me
And then bury her on top of me

Jealous of her shadow dude

Jump without a parachute

You ain't gotta never move
Lookin' all edible
And I'm ready when you're ready to
You already knew
Girl you already know
I ain't never lettin' go
I ain't never lettin' go
Addicted to your love, a motherfucker need a Betty Ford
Your gon' have to cut me off with a sword
And if you ever leave me, I ain't leavin' nothin' but a note
While I'm hangin' from the second floor
And when you don't come home
Then its vroom-vroom, boom-boom
Nigga ridin' round checkin' doors
Oh Lord
Psycho, you got me psycho
Baby come at me I'm not backing down
I never knew a girl would have me out here trippin'

Now you want it?  'Cause we gon' bring it y'all
So now y'all got a twenty pack
What's your address?
You're welcome
And not your email address neither
D6: Reloaded
Front door, leggo
A Dedication!
Looking in the mirror, all I see is money
Bop-bop, but if I was blind, all I hear is runnin'
Plug went to jail Saturday, 'posed to meet him Sunday
He said his bitch flushed the work, time to do some plumbin'
Gotta love the way we comin' though, we keep it comin'
Wolves never cry wolf and you could feed us onions
Pledge allegiance to the region that's beneath and under
The southside from your blind side, Stevie Wonder
Hunger Games, ain't no games when we speakin' hunger
We greedy fuckers, eat your supper, pick our teeth, and mug you
The pockets bustin' out the muscle, bitch, I'm bleedin' blubber
And I been drunk and I can't trust you 'cause I'm seein' double
And I been ballin' like the Rucker, nigga, triple-double
And now it's war, and they want peace, but it won't fix the puzzle
You drop the ball, if you a beast you won't be quick to fumble
If I'm too deep then get a bigger shovel, dig a tunnel
If you a beast then that bitch can't get a nickel from you
I'm the only one that speak when we in the huddle
Make a pussy nigga leak, then jump in the puddle
We comin' deep to your street, 'bout to rent a shuttle
Every day of the week, if I hit the streets, I gotta hit a hustle
Every day of the week I gotta get loaded-loaded, skip the bufferin'
I got it made, and with that said, I gotta tip the butler
I like my bitches mustard, business hushed, and Bentleys custom
Bitches sufferin' 'cause the system fucked 'em, now they fuckin'
They can't hide their battle scars but they can hide their stomachs
Niggas like Niagara Falls how their mouths are runnin'
But we making caviar out of flounders, guppies
Stand tall, but I'm a munchkin to my pile of money
Got down and dug it, found a nugget, made a mountain of it
Don't need a crown, gown, or nothing; I'm the king of subject
Chocolate, brown, cream, and fudgie, and I'm peanut buttery
Fuck the fuckery, I go skullduggery, it get ugly
Niggas thuggin', we got babies smugglin' in their Huggies
Niggas jugglin' different kind of drugs, Feds strugglin'
Sippin' Actavis, activist like Fred Douglass
Goodnight, sleep tight, watch the bed buggies
She give me ass, she give me head, I call it head-buttin'
Walk in a room full of buttons, press the red button
Blow this bitch to shreds, get my skateboard and shred somethin'
Lead pumpin', you dead, pumpkin
Go 'head, dump 'em, redrum 'em
Goin' hard in the paint, Andre Drummond
Headhuntin', Good Will Huntin', still stuntin'
All or nothin', Warren G to Warren Buffett
Stormin', floodin', lightnin', thunderin'
Carter comin', like karma comin'
My bitch pussy's the warmest oven
Need morning lovin'
She foreign, Donald might bomb her country
Thick as fuck, no panties when she got on her onesie
Whoa
Time to get this paper though
You ape or ho?
Bitches in line to get this snake fo' sho'
We take the dough
If they don't pay the dough, and that's fo' sho'
We make 'em vegetables, and we don't even like vegetables
These niggas extra broke, we break a nigga down to decimals
We up in México to see the plug, and not electrical
High cholesterol, you niggas salty, I'm the pepper though
Your bitch ain't half a ho, she wanna be in my next episode
I'm a steppin' stone
And that .380, that's my chaperone
It blow like saxophone
And when the smoke clear I'ma stand alone
I'm from the terrordome
Yeah, that's New Orleans, home of methadone
Cops on megaphones
It's so much bad luck, ain't no leprechauns
I been called a stone, pocket full of stones
On the corner moving stones, Papa was a rolling stone
I'm so stoned, in this bitch, waitin' on Babylon
Bible on the dresser, next to the gun and Tylenol, silence off
Spike a bitch drink, like volleyball
Olive Oyl skinny bitches can't get in the ride at all
Not at all
I'm involved in a real private war, time to brawl
Niggas don't want Lil Tune to take these diamonds off
I'ma talk crazy to a deaf nigga, these niggas blind
I'ma still throw up my set, nigga, steel toe in your chest, nigga
"Hell no" to a yes-nigga, "Fuckin' right" to a bad bitch
She can fuck around and get her ass licked
Still can't get her ass kissed
Black fist, middle finger to taxes, the police and their actions
I'm still pickin' out mansions
Still dickin' down such-and-such, still fuckin' with so-and-so
Still fuckin' my bitch's friends, never fuck my woadie ho
Still talkin' about Hollygrove, still talkin' about coke and dope
On the set in that OVO, on the jet in that OVO
I don't threaten, I go for broke, wanna step and go toe to toe?
No bullshit at this rodeo, and all my clips Pinocchio
Tunechi, bitch, for nothing, drops mic
Well, I can't technically 'cause it's connected
But, but, you get the expression, Mula
Welcome, thank you for joining
Dedication 6, this some sick shit
Umm, first of all, I wanna thank Drama for doing this shit again, and always doing this shit for his dawg. My nigga, one time. Thank everybody involved, everybody involved. My team, my team is my fam. Everybody who put they fingerprints on this shit, 'preciate everybody
So the definition of Dedication has changed for me since the first one, since the second one, since the third one, whatever. It's because, umm, whenever I put it out, umm, it's life. And since I don't write none of my shit, I'm coming from the head. And what happens is, when you rap so long or when you do it so long, all the things in your head, you done used up. So what happens is you gotta start using something else and coming from somewhere else, and that somewhere else is ten times out of ten your heart. And, umm, that's what this Dedication 6 project is
But, uh, yeah, the definition is always different because I'm always going through something at that time of my life, you know what I mean. I prolly was fucking your bitch on Dedication 4, and the whole fucking shit was dedicated to her, you know what I mean. I dunno. Whichever one that wasn't, that didn't do as well as all of the rest of them, that was definitely the one that was dedicated to herLondon on da Track, bitch!
We catch a body and we laugh about it
I fucked her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Grinding, it's agonizing but it's gratifying
Skinny tires on a salad diet
Ooh, I lost my mind, I'm like "Fuck everybody!"
Yeah, I lost my mind, but I got extra copies
Yeah, I fuck so long, it feel like exercising
I'll test a lion before testifying
All I got is hitters in my squad
I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
I want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Zero fucks given
I make her come to the condo butt naked 'cause, bitch, ain't no stealin'
She still come visit, she don't wan' leave
She compared it to me leaving a witness
I said, "I get it," I keep some cocaine on me for the bitches
And this AK is not for decoration
Fuckboys give me the heebie-jeebies
I got a hit list like the Yellow Pages
Hey, if she can suck a dick and snort a Quaalude
Then, ooh, baby, you got my full attention
Champagne expensive, it taste good or vintage
Open your nose, I'll put some sugar in it
I don't fuck around with them fuck-arounds
Uh, I might fuck around and catch a body
Yeah, I got some niggas that'll hunt you down
Yeah, and catch you slipping like you playing hockey
Woo! We catch a body and we laugh about it
Yeah, I fuck her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Uh, money and drugs, I'm talkin' math and science
Ooh, skinny tires, on a salad diet
Chopper leave you with a half a body
Make sure he dead, before we leave, my nigga, grab his wallet
Ooh, I got the hook up on them rocket launchers
I told Obama, "Fuck with me, you know I got it"
Slime, you need to fuck with me, you know I got it
I know somebody that know somebody
Look, traffic dying, we still trap-or-dying
It's agonizing but it's gratifying
Squad! I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
Want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Hold up, you ain't got no hitters in your squad
I could get you killed, that's my real day job
I'm a crime of passion, I'm a fucking hate crime
Spit like I ate bombs, Eminem on 8 Mile
I'm the motherfucking man, Scarface, Facemob
Pockets looking like The Blob, chips like Cape Cod
Bust your motherfucking egg 'til I see egg nog
My bougie bitch ratchet, my ratchet bitch a straight snob
Hold up, who know how to read gang signs?
Cause we gon' throw 'em up and we gon' give 'em hang time
I got white, I got brown, sell it at the same time
That's that James Brown, and that's that James Bond, ooh
We catch a body and we laugh about it
It's catastrophic but we glamorize it
It's agonizing but it's gratifying
Skinny tires on a salad diet, ooh!
Chopper leave you with a half a body
No hesitation, no stall, like the bathroom crowded
Chopper so big, so tall, it could wrap around me

Sometimes I can't cut through that rough loop 
Get fucked so many times 'til it's "Fuck you" 
So, how you wanna do it? Baby, we can get it

Every time I did it, I hit it and hurt it, yeah

Then they pay homage, when did they find it? But
Now that they know it's a must I remind 'em, so 
They don't forget it, I underline it, and
I'm in the sky when the thunder's cryin', young'n
I been through all that, I done done what you sayin'
I put it down when the others was playin' 
When the jungle was open, I rolled in with the riders 
Stole food from the bears, and brought it back to the lions 
Hold court with the apes, I'm a gorilla but lighter 
Got the eye of a tiger, the heart of a fighter, yeah
Start 'em, ignite 'em , I walk through fire
Watch the flames start multiplyin', woo! Yeah

Shot ugly, but my arch right; come on, dawg–bark, bite 
Fork in the road, I'm always going right
Nowadays, knowing life, ain't no more road lights 
We can't see, but we gon' make it to the finish line
It's right there, the goal line
Right behind the scrimmage line 
Touchdown, check the scoreboard, gimme mines
Semi-9 fit me fine, hit a nigga twenty times 
Damn, then one more to the face 
Just so they close the casket like I pay to close the case 
I'm made, straight Mafia shit, front line, top rank
Ready to die for my shit , and the obvious shit?
If I talk about my rivalry they probably get rich
So fuck 'em, I'ma let 'em sit 
And I ain't ducking 'cause I'm right here, I'm chestin' up
I don't care who at the top of the stairs, I'm steppin' up 
See, you fucking up the money, baby
And that ain't good business
You starting to look like a witness 
And this is for the gangstas and the bitches 
The hustlers and the hoes 
Crossover? Whatever; Mainstream? No
'Cause Wayne thinks silent , Wayne'll never fold 
You heard it right here if the game was ever told 
Lift up your toes, and look under a rug
Trust me, that's history under all that dust
So, deep down in the dirty, there lies us 
Yeah, Cash Money Records, and I'm still upfront

And soon she's gonna find someone to love
And you gon find yourself, so all alone
One minute she love me, the next minute she hate me
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted

With my pen in my right hand and that's also my mic hand
Codeine in a Sprite can, ink on the white pad

And sometimes I'm right and sometimes I might
Cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright

She kept talkin' fifty-fifty, had to split, my dog
She kept on fallin' in and out of love, I tripped her dog
Told me eat or get ate, so I sipped her dog
I'ma go platinum, she single
She blow up my phone, but the bitch got no ringer
Bought her a ring but I left with a finger
Stack up my cake and I bust down some zingers
Hello, ho, you gots to go, ho
I'm on the road, ho, high profile, movin' work on the low
Smokin' OG, girl you gotta go

Now I'm on my Nicki shit, I don't need no frauds 
Time to raise the bar, rappin' like I passed the bar 
You would think I ride bikes, boy, the way I handle bars 
Real niggas in charge , we back for what's ours 
Poppin' all these blues, I might turn into an Avatar
They ain't wanna see me back, he's back
Human crack in the flesh, sorry, I had to relapse 
These niggas weak, whack, I twist 'em like weed wraps
Still on my Nino Brown, still getting G money on G-packs 
No Stunna Man, bustin' like Duh Duh Man, it's evident
These hoes love me, they say my dick is they medicine
Cosby, spikin' gelatin, still pushin' and pedalin'
Settling never, I'm like DiCaprio in The Revenant
Still whippin' and stretchin' it, two pots, ambidextrous
I'm a beast, a dog, I see that money, I'm fetchin' it
Your ho throwin' it at me, I'm catchin' it
Don't check me, go check your bitch
You don't want to get me out of my element
From a tenant in the tenements to owning my residence 
Phone still clicking, I feel like the receptionist
Out of this world, yes, he is, extraterrestrian 
My life's a fucking movie, boy, don't get yourself edited 
I'm like Steph at the free throw, that piece blow, I never miss
Taught your girl how to whip the girl, now she a lesbian 
You can level up, still won't be on my level then, it's level ten
These niggas hot, I must be kettlin'

Roof missin' on this whip and I need two kitchens 
Your bitch say I'm number two, yeah, too different

Boy, I expose the truth in lies 
Cross me and get crucified, no shootin' five
War's on, that bazooka rise, get neutralized
Shoot five times five, watch you divide
In a sheet like the sheik ridin' through Dubai 
Game back in a chokehold, the noose was tied 
Suicide, it's a suicide
Tell 'em seek and you will find 'cause I'ma lose my mind
Kick a nigga ass, then give him my shoes to shine
It's do or die, I come from where we used to crime
The Uzi 9 more important than school supplies, the pools is dry
My niggas and the food is fried, the news is lies
The pigeons is too spooked to fly, the rules denied
All the toughest goons is mine, that's Tunechi's slimes
They kill you and go do the time, we unified
Young Money revolutionized the new design
We had to leave the flukes behind and supersize
The numbers through the roof and sky
Don't look too surprised, look through the lines
We makin' moves and strides, grooves and vibes
I'm too alive, these hoes need to be supervised
They put on a cute disguise, you grooms is blind
She get dick and an Uber ride, number two with fries, I'm pimpin'
Now, who am I? I'm who and why
I'm rude and kind, my cars are computerized
I'm cruisin' by, smokin' blunts Ruben size
You fools can try, these tools getting utilized, you euthanized
Brrt, skrrt, shoot, then drive
Now, who survived? We comin' back to rewind
I'm usually high, sippin' on the Houston wine
Feel humanized, I want my throne to recline
Jackie red, Julie blonde, they Cuban fine
I bruise they spine, I leave and they snooze 'til nine
Superglued to the grind, my crew my tribe
These bitches try to divide, we too divine
Got the drugs to provide the coolest highs
The greenest green and the white with the bluest eyes
The syrup and the juice collide, the two combine like suits and ties
Magic, poof, goodbye

Latest car on the market with the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a little bulky

This here's Tha Carter II, people
This is Tha Carter II, people
Hey! They call me... Mr. Carter, I kissed the daughter
Of the dead's forehead, I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers, gracias!
I'm crazy, yes, it's obvious, going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulder and a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffin', I'm just pitchin', your honor
I ain't snitchin', your honor
Hate bitch niggas, bitches with power
Vacate when that kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter, open the cabinet, close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet, drop a fo' in the bubbles
I remember being young, tryin' to hustle my dope
Tryin' to tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Tryin' to tell you 'fore you jump that my Mac ain't broke
You ain't trying to see how far that black back lane go, no!
Call me Pac-Man, your ghosts is blue
I got my red river rubies and my ocean blue jewelry
Usually I'm a hooligan for the money
Yeah, I'm eating, but I got a tapeworm in my tummy, oh!
Make harm and I bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight-arm, no warning, nothing
Look, it's morning, no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleeping, I'm up, tryin' to take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 504 you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me, bitch, I will be here
Cash Money is an army, Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from me but I still be here
No chrome on the Continental, I'm so fundamental
Crack the Phil', crack the roof and roll up the windows
And my hood love me, they tell me bring it home
That's why I holla Hollygrove on each and every song
You leaping at a dog, a dog with no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa, I'm talking 'bout Stunna
He like "Keep your dough", he got ya ho
And the sun shines on the King and sets on the Prince
I met the Birdman, and I been shining ever since
Like that!Everything was meant, everything was meant
I took a L, what comes after L? My nigga — Ms
That AK with the twins, that's Mary Kate and sis
My shooters, they don't miss; fade away, then swish
Dedication 6, and every day we sick
Treatin' medication scrips like some Revelation scripts
I thought yesterday we quit
But you know, every day we spent
Then we celebrate the win like we'll never play again
Lord I just talked to my hitman, he say that he made a list
Nigga always breakin' in, and he never leave a print
And I never shaved a brick, OK, now I'm talkin' shit
Where that bakin' soda mix? Raise my Arm & Hammer fist
And my yellowbone, she thick, and her belly don't exist
And she never saw the gym, she stay healthy 'cause she strip
Doin' very late events, and I never paid a cent
Pussy never leave a scent, Toni Braxton, breathe again
Every day, all week, we lit, you know every day we sip
And we having steak and shrimp with some naked waitresses
Told that bitch to bring a friend, you know that we make 'em kiss
She know if it's goin' down, I keep a elevator lit
Now where the elevator music? Yeah, they better play the hits
I can serenade a bitch, you interrogate a bitch
If we interrogate that bitch, we be like "Where that safe at, bitch?"
Put that barrel to her tits, and if she hesitate, that's it
I need that combination bitch, 'cause I ain't got no patience bitch
I hate to do it, but the line between love and hate is thin
You know every day we win, you know second place ain't shit
You know that we take the kids, just like Freddy, Jason, IT
You know that we spray and dip, one-eight-seven, eighty-six
While you eatin' bacon grits again while police takin' tips
You know every day we drip, drippin' wet Mercedes-Benz
Drippin' wet and glazy clit, you know every day she drenched
This that Dedication 6, you know every day we sick
Give me wet, a life, a gift, catch a body like the Lyft
This that Dedication 6, if she starstruck, make a wish

Pussy make me hard, pussy niggas make me nauseous
I've been on my feet since the day I started walking
Bitch, I think I'm MC Hammer, put the nail in the coffin
Sell coke in a drought, sell pussy at an auction
Bullets got a nigga running fast enough to race horses
Around here you sniff these lines, you don't cross 'em
Kill your ass and leave you behind like an orphan
I swear it happens all the time, very often
Still getting baseball money; Barry Larkin
Around here we play for keeps, yeah, we eating, but we starving
I get me a little money, try to spread it margarine
I'm flyer than a motherfucker, all my flights chartered
Green kush, red flag, black car, white lawyer, I'm good
I say I go into my beastmode - rapping niggas, I eat those
I tell a bitch take a deep breath then bend them knees like a freethrow
I don't want me no good girl, I fell in love with these freak hoes
In my bedroom I make a movie, it's starring me with that Lee Rose
Cause I ball hard like D-Rose, my stash on closet
Racks in my pocket, these racks I deposit
Got racks on my conscience, money on my mind
I got shooters on my team, they got bodies on their nine
Look at that bad bitch right there, see that body on that dime

Shawty told me she loving my swag, I make that pussy too wet
You niggas banned, and my hoes and I'm like why they'd do that? Go
Uhm, I don't have a conscience, all my friends are monsters
They visit me so constant and talk to me about nonsense
Like stabbing you and then watching you fight for your life like you boxing
Bitch, deuce deuce, I smoke that OG killer Bobby Johnson
I'll olly over that bitch head, it's Hollygrove til I'm fucking dead
I did a bid for that toast, so fuck with me I'll treat you like butterbread
But I still go hard with no regard, Earth ain't shit, bitch, go to Mars
Leave a nigga dead in the gutter
I'll just beat him with a bloody ass bowlingball
I'm fresh as hand sanitizer, don't hate the game, just analyze it
Two xanax', I'm fantasizing about fat bitches' panty sizes
Take a bullet to the chest, be a man about it
Stop acting like a little bitch nigga, most of y'all niggas is bitch niggas
I got a tiger in the basement, Big Tigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My hair long, my dick bigger

We lived, we died, I stayed, you LEFT!
Remember how we played to the left?
And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self
'Member B and Slim would leave and the keys over?
Tell us not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia
While I watched you reunite wit yo souljas
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the Stunna
Yeah, those were the times my brother
Now I recognize real and I eye my brother
Yeah, nigga, Semaj my brother, the Sqad's my brother
The niggas you left behind is my brothers!
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin again
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club poppin
Many nights we were blowin trees, many nights we were hustlin
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you through the very end, for only you I'll sin againI hate gossip
And I don't walk around looking for it, you know?
But, yesterday it seemed to just
Wander around 'til it found me
You know like, the gossip found me
Then why don't try provin' it?
How? You don't know how to prove it?
Well, what you just do is, stop
Stop hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion, the lady of a nigga
And you can get tipped like you're waitin' on a nigga
Put a body bag and a apron on a nigga
I give my all behind the mic
But you can never see if you sit behind the light
And you don't have to pick me to win the title fight
But I'mma wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is Snow White
I'm tryna be polite
But you bitches in my hair like the fuckin' po-lice
And my flow is rare, these other rappers nice
These other rappers bark, some of 'em even bite
But I'm much more bright, I give the game sight
So before you dim the light, you just might, might wanna
Think it over
Ooooh, think it over
Think it over, baby baby 
Stop! Analyzing, criticizing
You should realize what I am and start epitomizing
Legitimate, I got the heart of the biggest lion
I'm confident, like fuck 'em all, pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it's like my shit is dying
It rains a lot in my city because my city's crying
Because my city's dying
Still I emerge from all of that, I am a living pion–eer, near Zion
Fear God, not them, steer my robin coupe
Through the streets of the Boot, and soo-woo!
And then I leak blood in the booth, I leave a bloodbath
Sorry, there's a tub in the booth, now where the drugs at?
I'm twisted like the strings on a shoe, no, nigga, fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot, now where New Orleans at?
I feel hip-hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I-I-I must ask
Hey, haven't I been good to you?
 Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?
Drag my name through the mud, I come out clean
Cast away stones, I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem, I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me, don't believe me
I graduated from hungry and made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta, take it and eat it
But I'm gon' need cheese if I'm baking a ziti
You niggas want beef, I want a steak, and, uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where weed be
Hardbody nigga just takin' it easy
All about my paper, 'bout my paper like E-Z
Wider wrappers, why do rappers lie to fans, lie to rappers?
Lot of rappers lie like actors, cut the motherfuckin' cameras
Cut the check, nigga, fuck your props
And make it out to "Mr. Hip-Hop"
I'm not dead, I'm aliveGudda!
D6
Yeah
I'mma cash out on the AP, new freezer
The coupe sit nice on some new feet, new sneakers
I took your bitch out to Pappadeaux's
She tried to order a sloppy joe

150K cash, it fit in my pocket
This is that D6, shout out to Drizzy in the 6
Mafia like it's the Three 6
Choppers make niggas do B-flips
Put the heat to your moon like an eclipse
Burn niggas like a freak bitch
Flip and turn you like a key switch
'Cause you bit the hand that I feed with
Yeah, only time will tell, nigga
I sat back and tried to tell niggas
If you try to test me, watch you fail, nigga
D-triple-6, I'm raisin' hell, nigga
Death wish, death wish, death wish
I come to fulfill your death wish
First I must refill my beverage
That's promethazine, sold separate
That's from Texas, she's from who knows

Diamonds so bright on my one hand
Gave all five fingers a sun-tan
Haters upset, that's a fun fact
I got pussy in my lunch bag
I got soap and I got towels
Bullet showers lead to bloodbaths
I got hoodies that say 'Young Money'
I got bitches that steal them from me
They go home and then they send pictures
To my phone with nothing under it
What am I to do? I'm lovin' it
I run a bad-ass bitches company
That's my company, my bitches humble me
I saw your bitches, that was comedy
I got the romedy, oops I meant remedy
I got the chemistry, and the amenities
Up in my bedroom, holding assembly
They leave feelin' good; physically, mentally
Meditate, meditate; think about yesterday
Fuck what that nigga say, think about yesterday
I can't do everyday, I could do very late
Just hit me up and now go check my resume
Get out that Chevrolet, jump in this better Wraith
I know you see the doors open like Heaven Gates
She think I'm Heaven sent, and I would not forgive every sin
But I forget everything
Thanks to the medicine, thanks to the purple stuff
I'm finna pour it up, I'm finna stir it up
If I had a heart it'd be a purple one
Pockets too fat, I'm pulling my girdle up
Shots of Bumbu, I'm finna serve 'em up
I got them comfy and kind and courteous
I put the old bodies in the new freezer
Brrrr, I never heard of her, six shitTunechi
Baby
Uh, Lord I think I'm ballin' too hard
And my girlfriend think she too much
All she do is get pretty, I get shitfaced
Don't we make a cute couple?
To a broke heart we look like 2 bucks
I got a posse full of hitters
And a pocket full of "In God We Trust"
It's been so long since I said "It cost too much"
I'm so addicted to the fast money lifestyle
And withdrawal sucks
And dead presidents act immortal
But I know you see money's not a problem
Bal' like a butch bitch
Let's go on a shopping spree, take that shit to Goodwill
Money in a shoebox, what's up with all these shoeboxes?

All my kids already rich, and they kids, and they kids...
They think money grow on trees
And as tall as they grew, I climbed
Knock-knock "Who's there?" Hah!
I told the bitch "It's just money"
The road can get a lil bumpy
So, on the low, I got that blow
And ya nose gon' feel like a trumpet

Bitch, don’t try to suck my dick if you got cotton mouth
Watch these snitches, man, these rats think they Mighty Mouse
In the kitchen, Arm & Hammer, just the right amount
Got the dope spot popping, dope spot jumping
Car parked by itself, robot stunting
And it’s voice activated, I just tell it something
I ain’t even gotta press a button
Viper with the rally stripes, I don’t eat no Rally’s
I don’t eat my words, nigga, I don’t eat no salad
I got too much on my plate, I got too much on my palate
Never seen my car before, it’s like a unicorn in traffic
Too much fucking talent, rap Shakespeare, go Hamlet
You other boys could kiss the game goodbye, be romantic
Please don’t worry, Nancy, all my weed is organic
If my children end up smoking
I'll whip they ass if they don’t pass it
Hold up, I just got a package
I let my bitch test it, with flying colors, passed it
Burning money fast like fire on the plastic
You dead man walking throw some tires on your casket
They say niggas in wheelchairs is half dead as it is
I still keep the heat on me, attitude cavalier
Boy, I think your whole clique’s Summer’s Eve, Massengill
Monastat 7, Vagisil
And my name don’t need no adjectives
And my flow don’t need no ad-libs
The boot, the battlefield
Flag red, like I’m Russian, call me Vladimir
Took a picture with the pistol, gave it rabbit ears
These niggas got fast careers, fast as Batmobiles
My bitches got sex appeal, they like sex and pills, for reals
I’m sorry if you hate you, and I’m sorry for the wait, too
Boom – It’s my shot like Biloxi
Even my shadow don’t trust me
Big dog in this shit, like a Husky
285, 20 pounds of musty
Stopped by the spot, had to serve Pooh bear
He buy one, I front him one, so I left two there
In a two-seater, pull up popping 2Pac
Didn’t have a safe, so I stashed it in my tube sock
Eat so much Benihana's I need nunchucks
You just a old nigga always saying, "Big bruh"
You a bad bitch always saying, "Big Daddy"
You a real nigga talking ‘bout you want a selfie
Uh, a baby bottle with my shit in
And my role model was a kingpin
I say, "Let’s work," he say, "Let’s work"
Let your next work be your best work
And it’s that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
And I’m so sorry for the wait, too
From New Orleans to the A, TRU
You test my homies, we ace you
Tity, these niggas monkeys in ape suits
I got a city, got a ocean, got a lake view
She took some shots til she shot down a grey goose
Ooh, this that Sorry 4 The Wait DeuceUh-huh

Born in New Orleans, raised in New Orleans
I will forever remain faithful, New Orleans
I thank you New Orleans, thank you Hollygrove
That's been my hood since a snotty-nose
I come through the hood, suicidal doors
I used to come through the hood on the handlebars
Gat in my draws, money in my pocket, crack in my jaws
I hope it don't dissolve
And you know I'm ducking Five-O and my moms
Young'un quick to go off like car alarms
Now, the young'un keep his mind on the Parmesan
Them other niggas ain't eating, like a Ramadan
Spit the shit that make you feel it in your chromosomes
Got some money, put my whole damn corner on
Young Carter, part three, I'm the cornerstone
Eagle Street, keep it going 'til homies home
And I'm just lightin' up my...

Can I kick my story to y'all?
My glory in God, my faith in my flow
I pray that I go where no other rapper has
And when you're rappin' as
Vivid as I, your limit is the sky, so I
Study B.I., I bang 2Pac
I hum Aaliyah, and Soulja Slim was a leader
Who am I not to follow greatness?
I give these MCs hell like they all atheists
Tell them hatin' niggas, "One!" like they in The Matrix
And tell the cops I can buy my own bracelets
I'ma keep the paper running like a pair of ASICS
Used to sport the Gucci Bucks, nigga, no laces
Striped Polo, five-pocket Girbaud
Mama got her tubes tied and rocking dolo
I used to have the starter jacket with the logo
And the hat—me, myself, I had the N-O: that's the Saints, nigga

It's Lil Wayne, I'ma shine in the rain
Now, nothing gets cleared without me signing my name
I'm just headlining the game
Won't quit until I'm A-Rod in the game
They riding the bench, they not in the game
I misplaced the key to the lock and chain
My spot remain, like a bleach stain, or cranberry
It's Murder She Wrote like Angela Lansbury
I remember being small, man
New toys when my mom would win the card game
Got my gifts before Christmas—didn't have to wait for them
I had a ten-speeder, scooter, and a skateboard, haha!
Then we moved to the suburbs
Me and lil' Toya Johnson was lovebirds, aww, man!
And I swear, I feel born again
I'm in the building like the audience, just lightin' up my...

On the road to riches
Tappin' my horn, so watch for the beep 
Rippin' this shit to pieces

I come from the city of God 
I walk around in the city like God 
Made it out and still come back
Somebody, please tell me, what are the odds?
On this mic I am a wizard, but this is not Oz
Cold but hot, I can turn the summer to fall
I'm sicker than y'all
Don't talk to me unless you talkin' 'bout paper
I'm buyin' some acres, no time for a neighbor
I'm from New Orleans, yes, I am a gator
I’ll do you a favor, and not do you a favor
'Cause if I do you a favor
And you don't come back with that paper
I'ma have to lay hands on you

I got my married hoes on single drugs
Got my fattest hoes gettin' finger fucked
And my trashiest hoes is clean as fuck
And my nastiest hoes is neat as fuck
Take your shoes off before you walk inside
Take your shoes off before you cross the line
I snoozed off on Father Time
Got my goons to go kidnap Daughter Time
Come to wet the party up, and whoever in it
Got one gun that shoot for seven minutes
I'm done shitting, niggas never spit it
I'm high class, niggas' elementary
Repetition, that's the definition
I'm a Hot Boy under air conditionin'
Shoot the gun with the left arm limpin'
George Jefferson in all seven minutes
Got a hot girl off television
With a very sticky unhairy kitty
In the right position, screamin' "You're consistent"
I sit there and listen like we talkin' business
I don't need her out here filmin' niggas
I'd really rather have her steal from niggas
I really travel like a pilgrim, nigga
Kush loud as Fred screamin' "Wilma!", nigga
I've been takin' time out to count the bands
Break a promise in the promised land
Going zagga zow off of zagga xans
From the middleman to the Macho Man
I've been talkin' shit up in Diddy house
Went to Disneyland, talked to Mickey Mouse
Then I figured out how to figure out
What I was figurin' out, you figure it out
Got a trigger man with an extra hand
My bitches sleep by my bitch's house
So every party is a slumber party
Sky is the limit, head in the clouds
While you runnin' round, I'ma run it up
You dumb it down, I ain't dumb enough
I hit the courtroom and stunk it up
High comin' down, plug comin' up
You gon' hold me down, you gon' hold me up
You don't know me, but you know what's up
And the coke was cut with some extra coke
Showed her more than love, she just shoulder-shrugged
She don't know it's love, it's not important love
As long as we can keep extortin' the plug
Just let him bleed and ignore the blood
Just let him be and ignore the buzz
Pour it up, catch a sugar rush
Chopper full of rust, but it still bust
Bust good as fuck, every bullet struck
Like a hundred holes, got a hole-in-one
Safe full as fuck, money full of dust
And I'm pulling up in that "What the fuck?"
That's a muscle car, got me lookin' buff
If you look enough, you a mussel, punk
That's a Bugatti on steroids
Bugatti on Chevron
All-white like an Altoid
All these rings on, call me Bellboy
From the Teflon to the Kevlar
Don't mean shit when your head off

Snap my fingers, dollars appear
Out of nowhere and I don't do L's
And I married the mob when I was like twelve
Turned out well, like Tom and Giselle

Your girlfriend likes me and my friends 
If we hit it, that oui is not French 
I'm anti-social, pardon my tints 
We left E11even, at 11 AM 
Raw papers full of peace, cups full of mayhem 
We all wavy, I'm just sort of on a different wavelength 
See they more like superstars, I'm more like Super Saiyans 
Bein' the greatest ever is my destiny still 
Since a child I focused on my Kelly, Bey, and Michelle 
Sittin' back, getting head from a mademoiselle 
Tryin' to put every ghetto kid with a dream in my will 
Dedicated to you for the 6th time, killed it on the 5th one
Now they say I'm big time
While them niggas skipped lunch, I learned how to skip lines
I learned how to kick, punch, power through to get mines
Used to fuck with Sega, my uncle had a pager 
I knew this drug kingpin that tried to run for Mayor 
Posted on the back blocks, talkin' player-player
If she bad then I upgrade her, get her unlimited data 
They tryin' to build a wall, man my dogs gon' hate that shit
And build underground railroads, so the Maybachs fit

Talking 'bout a war, that's a convo at the bar, wait
Drugs in the Broncos, start the motherfuckin' horse race
I take off from Earth and take your bitch up into MySpace
I tell her keep her mouth shut, if not, I got some Scotch tape
Got to keep the lock safe, referring to the Safelock
The shelves fall, the ground shake, it make it do the James Brown
I still wear the same crown, light-skin or light-brown
I still dick her right down, hit her with the pipe bomb
Some niggas like to fight crime, some niggas like to fight fair
Some niggas got the right time, you ask him, he say, "Time'll tell"
Some niggas think they're icons, some bitches think that I care
Some niggas got a iPhone, some niggas had a SkyTel
Some niggas really pythons, I'm watchin' out for myself

Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back
Woah
She say, "I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
I saw some pictures of you boo'd up, it looks like you're starting to like 'em skinny"
I say "Girl, you a trip," she say "I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'"
She say "Watch these hoes, 'cause they leeches like Robin" I say, "No, Robin Givens"
She was sittin' on my lap and you know a nigga strapped, I know she feel it
It's crazy out here, I'm just protecting myself, you know I'm winnin'
She say "I get it, and if anything was to happen to you, I'd be livid"
"You ain't gotta worry 'bout that, I'll kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit"
Come up missing, think they caught a big fish 'til his body come up drippin'
I treat her legs like like a grand opening, smiling while I cut the ribbon
I took a pill, she took a pill, we was chilling, 20 minutes, now we feel it
She say "I know you probably hear this shit a lot, but you the shit in my opinion"
I said, "It never gets old, thought I'd never say never, but I did it
She say "Who you kidding, boy? You like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
I admit it, big booty, big titties; I admit it
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react

Then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable
Okay, I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
Saw a flick of you boo'd up, boy, you never liked em skinny
You tell me I'm a trip, well, I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'

She took her clothes off and I stopped
Looked at my watch, like "Fuck it, why not?"
Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord
She say, "I know you thought that you was about to get a quick fix, hit it, quit it
But you know you ain't been with a good, thick bitch in a minute"
I say, "You ain’t never lying; thought I’d never say never, but I did it"
She said "Speaking of a line, are you finished? All we need is a witness"
"Girl you trippin', young nigga still livin'"
She said, "Who you kidding, boy? you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
I admit it, I like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties; I admit it

With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back
I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry
Then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckableI loved her fancy underwear, I sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get to tell her
I'm the one she should be with
She's popular wit all the guys, so innocent in my eyes
I can see her in my life, she woulda had the world if she were mine
But see, she had other plans, I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, Varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all
She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around
They loved her fancy underwear, every boyfriend, every year
She tried to keep them entertained
When they can hardly remember her name
She did everything she could just to make them laugh and treat her good
She finds herself alone, askin' herself, where did she go wrong
She didn't realize she chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties, tryin' to apologize
Never forget the day she left and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all
She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around
Yeah
Yeah
Oh
Uh
Uh
She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn aroundI'm calling you daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy, daddy?
I need a daddy, daddy
Would you be my daddy, daddy?

Tattoos on her waist, she like the tattoos on my face
And if there's something she'd like to say
I let her say it on my microphone
She love my style...but that's expected
She coming back to you? The chances anorexic
I knew she had it in her, so I got it out her
She give me neck around the clock: I call it "round the Carter"
She rub my back, she say I'm tight
She cook, fuck and clean
And still make her flight!
First-class pussy, crystal glass pussy
I get it wetter than bass pussy
I likes it thick and red
Ralph Lauren spread
Lady in the streets, porn star in bed
She like to fuckfight, so we spar in bed

She kiss mine, and I kiss hers back
If she's a bad bitch
She deserve that

You might hit a wall, or end up like me
You might have to crawl, but get up like me
And you bite before bark, never I before we

Well, you’re gonna get shot with them bothI keep the blammer in the drawer with the pajamas
I keep the ammo in the bananas
I keep the standards high as the Canyon
I treat the Grammy's like some medallions
I treat the randoms like some companions
I treat the weed like some azaleas
I got more value than I got failure
I got more flings than I got flair
I don't dream if I do not have nothing to wear
You see what I mean, and that's why you stare
I know you believe, I know you beware
I know she a fiend, and this an affair
If momma a queen, and poppa a bear
You run out of steam, you run out of stairs
I run in Supreme and get something rare
She run to the team, and now she a player
We live on the edge, we die in the air
We sick in the head, but pockets is well
We tiptoe on eggs, we out of our shell
Our vision is red, the eyes are as well
We can't pay attention, we got to pay bills
It doesn't make sense if it's not making mills
We do not take pictures, we're not taking L's
If y'all love to listen, then I hate to tell
If y'all scared to visit, then I take it there
If heaven is real, then y'all fake as hell
Cut off your heels and bounce on your tail
I'm on a mission, survival is real
Man, fuck how I fix it, admire the repairs
I'm talking six but my mind is on twelve
Poppin' prescriptions on top of the hill
Even the devil advised me to chill
I told that nigga, stay out of my hair
She just want to fuck in the throne
Shit get too deep and they dug up your bones
I'm sippin' that Sleep and I'm smoking that Gone
When you reach your peak, we gon' cut off your arms

This shit is sick and it get in your pores
And then you a corpse, and then it's the morgue
Me, I'ma hustle until it's the Forbes
I swore, it was no more than a chore
The house by the water, condo by the shore
I'm sure, I'm all about that manure
Cooler than leather and hot as velour
I'm not the one, when it is war
I'm on the front until combat is done
And I got your tongue, stomp on it once
Then smile at your young, they see I'm having fun
Shit don't get brazy 'til I say go brazy
Run up on your haven and pop at your nasal
Your baby gon' take me straight down to the basement
Gun to the head, she get down to the basics
No dramatization, we popping these gauges
Even the neighbors gon' feel the vibrations
Behind desperation, it's just in our nature
So cold-hearted, perspiration turn to glaciers
Ovations, better be loud and bodacious
And then I'ma take me a bow and be gracious
Wipe the gun off with my towel
Throw it in the crowd and then take a pow at the spacious
I'm out of my mazes, I'm out of my cages
I'm out of the labels, I'm kind of escapist
I profit, I praise it, I spend it, I save it
I buy me a nation, you renting on Avis
I'm in it, I sit it, I did it, you said it
You killing, you playing, I'm friendly, I'm faded
I get way too high to get through the hiatus
You look in my eyes and my pupils dilated
I'm true to my ratings, I'm glued to my statements
I just want to dive in the pool of my payments
I'm in and outrageous, I'm rippin' out pages
You runnin' your mouth, seein' how quick you can chase it
And then you rephrase it, we stick to invasions
The stick is malicious, equipped with a laser
The temperature blazin', the tension is raisin'
You smell the dead once, gotta live with the fragrance
Sickness is real, the meds is too tasty
Death is related, happy we made it
Keeping it dirty like Sanford and Grady
The Young Mula Baby, I'm back from the 80s
Dedication, sick, shit
My favorite movie quote is "You got 14 bricks in that bag right there?" That's my favorite movie quote. That was Cam talking to, uh you know Mitch and all them, that was uh, damn I always forget the name of the movie and it's my fucking favorite quote but it ain't my favorite movie, but like that's my favorite movie quote.

Challenge me, that be to my advantage
I'm outstanding, like standing outside up in the twister and walking not damaged
Standing outside up in the blizzard and walking hot handed
Serving nicklebags in Iraq, bet I will not panic
Swerve the nickel black, if I wreck, bet I will not panic

My ho pussy hole is wetter than your dreams nigga
My ho legs spread wider than your wings nigga
Put your head in a microwave, DING! nigga
You out of character, slime, you out of character

These niggas trying to be hoes
What happened to that boy and I ain't Pusha T though
Supa where the cup at

The girl I'm with got much class
But she got a dumb ass

Rappers in my lunch bag
Me and Future have a food fight
Bedroom full of new dykes
Old green and new white
That's old money, that's new coke
That's Young Money, that's 24/7, 3-6-5
That's Cash Money; I'm like "Who ho" Who ho, who ho!?

Get money 'til I'm dead or 'til the day of my arraigning
Spittin' game through the platinum smile
You can see the fuck I be saying from half a mile
How I hop out of the colossal Tahoe filled up with models
Poppin' bottles with pussy poppers that gobble until they swallow
See I'm a pimp Playboy when it come to these hoes

But now I'm more mature, I fuck 'em, fuck 'em, and fuck 'em
Stuck inside of the game for damn near two decades

Choppers pop at any time for any given reason
Leave 'em not breathing under cement for one disagreement
Freedom, we ride on them bitches, rollin' through sittin' high on them inches
My mission's to make sure Squad get expensive
And if anyone of you niggas better get defensive, your care will get intensive
Shot put humps on top of your head like Bart Simpson

The heavy platinum jewelry bling over the white tee
Watch your wifey, she's mostly likely to blow me pipey

Money, murder, steal, kill, rape
You should do like the Internet and start to Bill Gates
This whole world gon' end up with some bad fucking tumors, listening to these Cash Money rumors

Treat you like a bitch, bitch look at me while I do you

Swigger off the Piña Colada
Dreams of having cream and the power
You need a problem? I'm the meanest to start with
And got grams the size of the head of Gina on Martin
For any discomfort the Ninas is sparking
Be in your apartment, many assault men and semi-revolvers
Keep it clean, I'm a young Sqad street teen, only into green

And y'all just look like bitches
You get fucked then I nut up
And just like bitches, I leave you face down and butt up

I'm the alleged convict in any Sqad incident
Last name Carter like Vince and shit

Cadillac white walls and 'Bauds, pimpin' partna
Plus I can get more work out than a fitness doctor
Let's get this partna, I'm the young don these niggas honor
And those of you who ain't cheap can't buy a vowel

A baller blocker or something, I'll send your noggin a hundred
Have the whole block sprinting, dashing, jogging, and running
Type of life I live, Gotti would love it

I mean I got a wife at home, you know me, holla, ha, holla
Bitch I can't love you
Holla, hahaha

Homie I go hard, push a whip with no hair on its head
So all I'm feeling is air on my head
With some ho that you might know, she sucking all the air out my head
Meet you close to knock you square out your head
Sip the Cris’ to clear out my head and try to get my loot up
In Cuba with a translator ?? coke newer
Plus the prices is cooler
I come back through the hood with that dirty
And tell 'em I'm like Tiger Woods, all I got is birdies
Got bitches in they 30s calling Weezy poppa
But Weezy not daddy bitch, cause Weezy in and out ya

Boy, boy, boy
Ok
I spit it for them niggas who run the corner, palm the revolver with honor
Any beefs involving homie, your momma
Homie we swarm out the Eddie Bauer, thoughts to devour
Spark and shower, we get more stupid than Austin Powers
Smell the aroma of marijuana, Coronas when upon us
We do just what the neighborhood have shown us
We murder opponents and don't think about it, forget about it
Niggas won't do shit about it
Wave the pistol, get the bitch up out 'em
I'm off the hinges, chicks on my dick, proper than Cindy Crawford
Any problems I pop the chopper and knock the appendix out him
Hit the block with bricks of powder
What you know 'bout doing that?
And splitting a key with flour, making it two in fact
Dawg I'm all street, if you want Hip-Hop, here's what I give you instead
I'll make you hip out when them fuckin' bullets dig in your leg
Positive niggas talking spooky, y'all ain't scaring nobody
Y'all love Mos Def, I love fucking John Gotti, holla
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aight

I wish that there was no taxes, no cases, no police, and no racists
No rapists, wish they had a 700 Mercedes
Wish my Sqad live happy
I wish my kids grow stronger than me
I wish my momma live longer than me
I wish the cops stay off the corner this week
I wish the gutta, ghetto neighborhood hunger would cease
I wish them niggas who ain't got shit would stop hating on niggas who got shit
And you know I wish for Pun, Biggie, and Pac shit
I wish that I could get high but when I'm high I wish I wouldn't get high
Sometimes I wish I wasn't alive
I wish for Heaven gates to enter
Wish for Lakers' tickets at the Staples Center
My seats, floor me
Wish Chris Childs wouldn't of hit Kobe
When I see Lauren, I wish I knew why my heart burns
Wish 22 inch rims wouldn't rub on sharp turns
I wish these hoes stop lying
I wish these niggas stop lying
Wish dope heads stop using, as if they not dying
Fuck it. That's just some shit I wish for, fuck it
Aight. That what you want?
Aight, listen, listen

I wish I ain't have to sell records
Fuck, I wish I ain't have a jail record
Wish every bitch gave head
I wish I could've saved Dad
I wish I make money 'til I'm a dead man
I wish my chain wasn't heavy around my neck
Wish hoes wouldn't suck dick and try to kiss down my neck
Wish I ain't have to get locked up for slapping her to the ground for that
Bitch I wish you wouldn't wanna be down for that
I wish there wasn’t no droughts
I wish there wasn’t no fucking coke ??

Die for respect and hope, look beyond I’m a celebrity
Hold minds for ransom, head sold separately

Trapped in the jungle, can’t escape dawg
But I bet you be the last man standing like a 8-ball
And I ain’t worrying ‘bout ballin’ no more, I’m past that stage

And if any test the child he stepping on deadly grounds

And chase dough, slave hoes, and keep my head low

I’m sorry
What the fuck is “find him dest”?
I meant, “If someone frontin’ you find his death”
Death

Holla at us, check it
Pistols burning
Pop the barrel, turning
It got the faggots squirming
We closing any open shop we ain’t concerned in
Coke the size of Sherman Klump we flipped and doubled
And dropped the whip on dubs and dipped in Bubble
Get a bad bitch to hustle and move product
And split them niggas quick as fuck if them dudes try her
Not behind the ho, but only behind the dough
And behind the dough I kill whoever stand behind the door
You ain’t tryna go that route with the Sqad, it’s rough, I promise
We kidnap your mommas and sit our johnsons on her tonsils
We reside inside the S. Q. bombers
And we leave families emotional like Carl Thomas
So stay from ‘round us
And to be honest, ain’t nothing for me to do away with you
I be the same nigga that blow a Tre with you
Then let a K hit you
Fuck you nigga, I ain’t got no love for none of y’all

Take heed to the shit that gleam on the left side of my waist
Or take three to the left side of your face
A multiplatinum artist still riding with TECs and 3-8s
A hustler, you can see the crack residue left on them plates
They fucking with me, I’m predicting death on them snakes

Ride in a Benzy
Fuck it, tryna fire my enemies
Fire a sack, recline back, and feel me

Passing green and brown chocolate like John Stockton

Find me in a Benz – aqua blue
Rims colossal dude
And right under the seat’s a Glock or two
Don’t make me pop at you
And got two Hawaiian tropical bitches that will swallow you
People ask me “Weezy, why you do it so big?”
I pop my collar, drop the roof off the 6, then shoot up the bridge
Listen, I’ve had loot since a kid

A nigga been wishin' that I could reverse it
I know it don't help it, I know I look selfish
And looks are deceiving, but you lookin' further
And you lookin' past me, I'm just a has-been
How did this happen? What is the current? Where's your endurance?
You actin' like you've never been in love, like you just a tourist

I'm starin' at the walls, I been punchin' these walls, did me nothin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout the ball I've been fumblin' when stars were abundant
Then shit happened, and all of the sudden the toilet start flushing
Try to avoid the confrontin', enjoy the consumption
With outside noise and seduction, it's harder to function
Look up at the angels, they hoverin', they show me the light
They told me that I know that I'm wrong, but I don't know what's right, goddamn
, you must hate me 
Love me or leave me
She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'

But they want me to wait for Simon to say it
But I am too faded, so talk to my agent
Or they talk about you to your congregation
Man, no conversation or negotiation
No affiliation by association

The nicest thing a fan can say to me when they approach me on the street is any fucking thing true, anything real. You know what I mean, that's the nicest thing. I mean like, even if its cliché, cliché I can still tell when that cliché was straight from your heart and that's all you could think about, all you could think to say when you saw me or if you meant it, like even if it's that, like I said just when it's real. You know why? 'Cause sometimes people can say things that's so real to them that they don't even know that, you know what I mean, some of the things they are saying isn't fact, you know what I mean, official. But you know, things like so what I mean like example: you might walk up on somebody, I might walk up on somebody on the street and they might, uh, they might... shout out the valet from today, umm well yesterday, shout out the valet from yesterday, before you opened the door of my car, you're looking in my eyes, you're a young cat too, you look me in the eyes and you say ahh, and he couldn't, his English wasn't all that, he said: I like the new album, I really like the new project, and I said to him I was like thank you man, he meant that, 'cause he looked me in my eyes and he even opened my door before he said it, you know what I mean, so I was like damn you know when I got in the car I was like damn it's not a project. You know what I mean I don't even consider that, it's damn sure not an album just a mixtape, you know what I mean, but to him that was real, that shit was real, could be a project not an album, so shout out to homie. I slid him a nice little tip you know what I meanDavid Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman

It's Mr. Crazy Flow
Jumping like a bungee, no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go –
Nowhere, I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down
It's going down like there's a whale in the boat
See, you can smell that I smoke
And yep, I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination, it make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water, yep, I swim with the big

And all you new rappers, you're just new lunch
Flow sick, so sick, need a doc, yes
A creature, monster, like the Loch Ness

I just tell the clock, "Gimme a sec"
In the middle of the war, where my enemy at?
I'm running this bitch, like Eric Bieniemy back
'Cause every time I hit a track I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out "Where the sympathy at?"
Yeah, if you betting money, baby, him'll be back
Whatever legends look like, bitch, I'm finna be that
I walked right in hip hop, like "Where my dinner be at?"
I ate that, and I was like "Where my dinner be at?"
I hate that women lie, so I lie to them back
Got two bitches in my pants, quiet, neither them that
A lot of bitches want dick, I give a lot of them that
Let's do a pill, I can fuck you for an hour with that

And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' Jon B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This for all the strippers 'cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell 'em "Back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it"
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back-and-forth faxes
My money coming full circle, get up on my axis
Maybe I'ma kill 'em, only 'cause I promised
They think I'm bein' cocky, but I'm only bein' honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party 'less I got some bottles in the booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just havin' patience, cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, Drizzy
 I just want y'all to remember
That this is the first mixtape you bumped
While you had a black president
Yeah, p-p-pass the dro
I am such a beast and you can ask them hoes
And they might even say you should leave me alone
And homie's scared, cause his bitch like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy, I tote that boom-bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I ain't talkin' marbles, you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm fallin', but up I fall
And if your bitch in heat, she could fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin' to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter, Carter, ball harder
Ten girls, penthouse suite, ya'll order
Whatever y'all please: wine, crackers, and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my tees
The supplement I've taken got me feelin' mighty
My gun and money don't split, call that shit Siamese
Yes, my watch make the frickin' time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap-ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And 18 Gs is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know 'bout it? My niggas so bout it
If you kill everybody, they can't go to court about it
Weezy, I ignore the liars, baby, I ignite the fire
I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy, obviously, pop one at your Ivy League
I don't have a rivalry, if so, you'll have a cah-sualty
Oops, I meant a casualty, oops, I meant catastrophe
Oops, I meant, actually, you niggas is just ass to me
And big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying
Or I hang you on the wall like a art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money
I got Cash Money, I got Young Money, bitch

We are not the same, I'm a muthafucking alien
Back on my saddle with my tool in my hand
Uptown real nigga, bitch, landed in the sand
Back home, nigga, did it for the land
For the grand with the money with the tool in my hand

High life: getting money then we go, niggaGangsta—
Gangsta—
Gangsta Grizzils
Well, tonight I found my price to the spender
And she cried about our life to the listener
And she asked me for advice, so I pimped her
Turn that chicken head to a chicken tender
In a Wraith, in a Wraith, out of state license plates
I got yay an AK and a temper
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Don't know how I'm drivin' straight
I sipped a lake of that grape, thirst quencher, oh
Girl, fuck with him and get your money
You fuck with me, you missin' money, then you miss your molly
I get the money, spend the money, then I miss the money
But it come right back, right back, right back
That's that Frisbee money
That's Santa climbin' down the chimney, money with the duffy
It come back, run around the gang, yeah that's some dizzy money
The Humpty Dumpty, she get on that dick, she's very comfy
I put a Rolie on her wrist, she used to wear a scrunchy
Party times, Tunechi wise
Wifey's size, truly lies
Booty, thighs, bougie pride
Gucci slides, moody, tired
Woozy, high, movie night
Jacuzzi time, ooo-ee, ahh
Dinner, prime; sushi, wine
And for dessert I have the cutie-pie
Lied about the price to the spender
And I lied about my height on Tinder
And if I hit it one time I won't remember
But can't forget it if she bring another member
Double date, double date
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
Bitch, I'm eatin' full plate like November
In a Wraith, in a Wraith
In a different mind state
Let her sniff some snowflakes and call her Winter 
Fuck with him and get the money
Then come fuck with me and split the money
I'll fuck her when she with her buddy
She guzzle dick and kiss her buddy
She said I love you when he send some money
I said I love you give your pimp some money
And she don't ask how much she just come dump it
And I don't ask how high I just start jumpin'
You ain't know I kiss below the button, what
Girl close your eyes and let me show you somethin', what
And if you ride me like the road is bumpin', what
I leave my key in and the motor runnin', what
Oh my god I hope they kissin' cousins
If they not it's gon' be consequences, repercussions
Woah, I just count a hundred thousand hundreds
And I told my babe ride the wave, Cowabunga
Lied about her night to her nigga
Her vagina 'bout to cry me a river
If she ask me for advice and I igged her
But she know it wasn't me, it was the sizzurp
Gotta wait, gotta wait
'Til I wake, 'til I wake
I wake up and tell bae how much I missed her
She looks straight in my face then start pointin' to the space
Where she want it on her face, she's particular

BelfastThe brains will start to abandon the religions
And believe in themselves
And the new world order will start
Drop that motherfucker
Narcissistic, insufficient, deadweight, I've been searchin' 
Lack of coexistin', just don't seem to work with other bitches 
That's when black and white, when dark at night, that's when I do my searchin' 
And the Anti-Christ is in my mind, the evolutions lurkin' 
I got voices in my head, wild horses in my head
Runnin' around, horse playin'
Breakin' pots up in my head, waking corpses in my head
And they was better off dead
Runnin' faucets in my head, stompin', marchin' in my head
Sun is scorchin' in my head
Archie Bunker's in my head, talkin' bunkers in my head
Willy Wonka's in my head
All this junk is in my head, then it sunk into my head
Little monkeys in my head
Goin' bananas in my head, shootin' cannons in my head
Hittin' targets in my head
Playin' pianos in my head, keyboards, organs in my head
Smash guitars in my head
Fast cars in my head, with loud ass horns in my head
Horns stickin' out head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head 
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
All these voices in my head
They're committin' arson in my head
Real wars up in my head, crash courses in my head
Fightin' forces in my head, white noises soundin' red
All these voices in my head, all these thoughts up in my head
Like a spark plug in my head, like a torch up in my head
Ain't no shotguns in my head, all these sharks up in my head
All these sharks need to be fed 
I behead a motherfucker for his contacts 
Take the body where the others can't see 
Seen the devil in my eyes without no contacts
My eyes are blacker than the bottom of the sea, yeah, yeah
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head 
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head 
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head 
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head 
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my headY'all know what this is
Tunechi Gang
Pump, what's up?
Lean made me swerve in the cruising lane 
Your money funny like Pootie Tang
Had to leave Cash Money, had to do my thing 
New password, new username 
My new teams loves having newer things 
One phone call and my jeweler came
I bought you and you and you and you and you a chain 
Daddy got bust at the gun range 
My drugs cost more than your mortgage 
The hoes gon' throw 'em out regardless 
I'ma throw the hoes another party
Nigga, I ain't got hoes, I got an audience, damn
Every week fashion week, runway 
Fly the bitch overseas, one way 
The bitch come around here and go both ways
Made her eat so much pussy, need a lunch break, damn
She don't even hable inglés 
Got the booty with the thighs and a shrunk waist 
And right between her thighs is an entreé 
And she know I'ma need more than one plate, yeah
And I look up in the sky through my sun shades 
Lookin' in the eyes of a sun ray
I ask it "Can I shine," it say "All day"
Made the sign of cross over the heart ray, amen
Boom-bang, red beam, blue flame 
Tunechi got clique like Hussein 
Stick that kick like Liu Kang
My bitch got tits and two chains
Damn, I'm tied to the track of a money train 
You blind to the fact, that's a fucking shame

Got the world on my back, you got puppet strings, yeah

Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang

My bitch love watching Boomerang 
My kids love watching Stranger Things
It's guerilla warfare, y'all orangutans 
She gon' hit the cocaine like a hurricane 
It gon' make her do a whole lot of other things 
It gon' make her takeoff then jump off of the plane
Make her race racecars in the lovin' lane, pyong!
Make her drop the top in the summer rain
Make her pussy come again, tell these pussies "Come again"
Fuck her hard fuck her soft, she want love and pain
She gon' have to walk it off or do the running man 
Nigga, fuck the game, fuck the game, fuck the game
What they think it's wonderland? Think it's fun and games 
These funny ass niggas think they Martin Payne
Try to walk it like you talk it, never walk again 
Hundred thousand flat in a rubber band
But I could get you whacked for some pocket change 
And my niggas snap like the paparazzi gang 
And you know they say a picture say a thousand things 
She wanna be with me and feel alive again
She wanna join a gang but she gotta train
I never knew her name, still forgot her name
Thots shall never ever thot again
I flew her to Columbia, her body changed 
She came back home with the model frame
Now all the hoes wanna know her doctor name
All these hoes looking for a power change, brrt
Damn, who that is? Him? Not again 
He don't get the picture 'til it's out the frame 
Nigga washed up like a box of Gain 
He don't get the scripture 'til the choir sang
Amen, Tunechi mane, Tunechi mane, mula gang 
Live life, Superman running through the veins
Street smart, nigga, I could be a tutor mane
My shooters aim at your motherfucking pupil, mane, bang
Don't talk stupid, it's your block, we gon' be loopin', mane 
My gang stay away from the trooper gang
Spit flame like my name King Koopa, mane
But if the pussy sweet, you can call me Sugar Shane, yayy!
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang
Groupie gang, groupie gang, groupie gang
Your bitch out of my groupie gang
Can't blame her, I give you to blame

Groupie gang, groupie gang
Your bitch out of my groupie gang
Your bitch fucked 'til the Uber came
My bitch love to do hookah mane
My black barbies got booty fame 
My white barbies got Hooters fame 
I'm a eye doctor that you should blame 
When she tell you she don't wanna see you again 
The lean made me swerve in the crusing lane 
Your money funny like Pootie Tang 
Had to leave Cash Money, had to do my thing

I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, "I said I've been lookin' for me"
I've been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
I've been lookin' at the cross and it just look like a T
Two fingers, I keep 'em crossed, I can't be lookin' for peace
I've been lookin' at the stars and they don't glisten for me
I've been lookin' in the mirror, he don't listen to me, sheesh
If I die before I wake 
Pray the Lord, my soul to take 
I lost count of my mistakes 
At least I learned along the way
And I don't trust nobody , not my lovers, not my friends 
I don't make no promises  'cause I know just how they'll end
And I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else 
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me
You gon' find a bunch of motherfuckers lookin' like me
I ain't ever lookin' back because the light always green
Safe to say I lost my way but I never lost the lead
Safe to say I lost the brakes but I never lost the speed
Wakey-wake, I lost some sleep but I never lost the dream
If you out there at the crossroads lookin' for me
You gon' find me with my eyes closed lookin' for grief
If I die before I wake 
Pray the Lord, my soul to take 
I lost count of my mistakes
At least I learned along the way
I don't trust nobody, not my lovers, not my friends
I don't make no promises 'cause I know just how they'll end
I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself, yeah
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me

Got a long way to go, young boy
Uh

Let 'em all in, bet 'em all in
Put me in the jungle, I get us all minks
Don't play with my wave
Know what? Let 'em all sink
I don't need therapy, I got so big
Even when they talk crazy I still don't shrink
I'ma black out, Michael Blackson's skin tone
Homie gotta sit for a while back home
Hotline bling if you get his phone
Gotta own up or you get disowned
Eyes dried up, I don't really cry much
And the gold chain match everything I touch
Whip gotta match every bitch I fuck, foreign
Y'all niggas talkin' 'bout what? Borin'
Bane from it, I came from it
I'm raised by it, I'm stained from it
Shot for the stars from the darkness
I aim from it, now change comin'
Who'd have thought a nigga shake somethin'?
All these records, I'ma break somethin'
Playin' my shit around the graveyard
Y'all fuck around and wake somethin'
Mean mug like I hate somethin'
Hit the stu' and I ate somethin'
Great rapper or a great hustler—
Promise you I die a great somethin'
And I am beginnin' and endin'
A nigga run in kickin' and flippin'
A nigga worth spendin'
A nigga with the semi admittin'
Glock is definitive on 'em, iron Emmys
Got an eye on 'em
Still on these niggas more than any one of you
We knuck if we buck, if you my brother we up
If not, I don't give a motherly fuck
Only in us we trust, you fuss we hush
They rush we bust, adjust, and dust and flushed 'em
If you don't know what my salary is
You 'bout to know what a fatality is
What the reality is
If I don't know what my calories is
Then nine times out of ten
You won't never know where your cavity is
Hit a forty, know it had to be his
A dude foul with a smile
They would never know how mad that he is
They don't ever know what pattern he is
He gotta be from Earth 2, or somewhere from out on Saturn he is
Now I'm goin' where no gravity is, some other galaxy shit
But we'd rather talk about the MAC and the bricks
We takin' on all names, it ain't no more games
I'm a stand up nigga, Cory Kaepernick bitch
I don't know what to call you
Niggas claimin' they loyal to the soil
But boy I'm loyal to the oil that boil
To court with the all you
You cannot avoid it when I'm gonna destroy you
Work from the ceiling to make sure that I fall you
I'm dedicated to this rhyme shit
S double, the militia gang, they don't ever try them bitch
I got a nine and click, a high been brick
A bottom bitch, I buy them thick
Drivin' stick, life's a bitch, and I give dick
I ride the five, my partner crip
Shout out the East, we parkin' shit
I just revive, I don't remix
I don't remind, until C5 we got D6, nigga
The best things in life are free, not cheap, free C5
Message, no reply
Rest In Peace, no peace sign
I keep an eye on these guys
My third eye give her sweet eyes
The bird eye's view keep spy
But I can get your wings deep fried
Try, try again, keep tryin'
All the traffic hours, you a taxi driver, we some maximizers
Ever heard of San Francisco 49'ers, we some masterminders
Made it to the top just to get sniped from the floor at the very bottom
Ain't that a bitch, man tell me about it
But I ain't trippin', unless the trip is private
I sip in silence
I tried to make it beautiful, and this shit came out perfect
Let the guns speak for they self, I ain't never been a loud person
Walkin' 'round the house in the turban
These niggas washed up with no detergent
Take your heart and I am not a surgeon
Pullin' triggers like shower curtains
Ain't got no soul because my baby sucked it out of me
Me and my whoas in Las Vegas playing the thot machines
Stick to my goals, expectations like a soccer team
Waiting to exhale only to let out some steam
Girl let's make a movie, what's a movie without a shower scene?
Treat my semi like an Emmy, need some nominees
Taught me how to count before they taught me how to read
I knew all my OG's before my ABC's
Damn
That's some sick shitHa! Peek-a-boo, bitch! Swag scare your kids

Shit, you know what I do, tell me what you tryna get into
The man car's rented, the man car killing
Gossipping? Fuck the car! Look at the man in it!
Ha! Boys-to-man business, we don't hire bitches

I cuss a lot cause bitch I'm serious young no beard

Got some new bitches, trail got em' laughin'
The one that gave me head can suck the nail out a casket
Shotgun on the kitchen table, bullet shells in the cabinet
Fuckin' with me is like steppin' on the tail of a dragon
Wet pussy is my cabin, more bitches than a pageant
I keep a house full nigga, call me Bob Saget
Spendin' time backwards, hotter than a cactus
And we ain't in the buildin', we the fuckin' contractors

I do this for the love of it; saliva, cause I love to spit
And I juke it; for my future records, y'all gon' love to spin
Fucking with my brethren, 10 years strong
And he put them dreads in: Silver John Long
But he's more like platinum; hold up, here's a napkin

No ceilings, muthafucka~Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Yeah, I wrote my will just the other week
It was funny, it was only one sheet
And I know there's only one me
But I hope I am everything my son be
I'm trying to live right, stay on the drum beat
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat
I wonder will I lose control of the Maserati?
And hit some tree, just being young me
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?
I can't go to hell, cause I'd take over
I feel it approaching but I ain't scared
I made that bed and I should rest in peace
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Yeah, and every time I see the sunshine
I drop down and give thanks at least one time
I'm feeling like I'm living on the front line
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunch time?
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night
Pistol on my lap at every single red light
I made my bed right, so when I do I should sleep tight
In peace I rest
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Bury me a gangsta cause that's what I live
Don't cry for me I gave the best I could give
I can only do me, so that's what I did
And I cherish every breath of my kid
And I don't wanna go before she grow, that ain't cool
But in this game of life, I don't make the rules
Shit, so that's why I get twisted
So I can't feel it when it hits me
And my moms don't need that on her
But I see death around the corner
And if he, so happens to make his way around the block
You gotta answer the door when he knock, believe that
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take for goodness sakeThank you

'Cause I've seen it, Lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it

The illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for
Hollygrove, One-Seven, Eagle Street
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet
But I believe in me

And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and rattlesnakes

Got money to validate

Different colored diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alleyway

First name Young, last name Stunna
Carter in the office, take notes when I'm talking
Smooth as a cruise boat floats when I'm walking
I boast cause I'm balling, I'm supposed to be balling
When I'm on the phone with bitches, man, the money keep calling
You ain't satisfied 'til your son'll be calling
Telling you where to leave the money in the morning
OK, you want a zombie movie instead
That's when you walk in your house and everybody dead

And watch you pussies piss in your pants
You ain't a man, you're a ho, I could kill him with the flow
And then play the guitar at the fucking funeral
Big guns so they drinking big shots

I’m lost in future, present, past
All those drinks I had
I speed, I'm fast, I blink, I crash
They say it’s my time
I’m racing time, I think I’m last
And if Tune mentions lean again
Then I might drink his stash
The underdogs understand what I lay over tracks
New school, but all I listen to is older raps
Bitch I still

I never think because I know
And pimpin haven't died and money getting old
And now the wrinkles starting to show
My rims twinkle like a toe

One thing led to another, and then the pencil broke
I got that; handgun on the table, shotgun in the closet
Police in disguises, I don’t like surprises
I don’t like tomatoes, I don’t like tamales
Shoutout to my plugs, I pray the rats don’t chew the wires
Straight ballin, you niggas just bald spots
When they tried to read my palms the pages were torn out
And you pussy niggas get hauled off
No cough drops
I’m tryna make the same cash off rap they made off pop
I’m off topic
I killed more than I did with a gun with a skill

Lose my mind, the only time I'd ever take a loss
I work too hard for taking off, rrt, I'm taking off
Really 'bout to see a billion, I'm in arm's reach
Sleep on a hammock in the middle of two palm trees

Cried my whole heart out, she cried with me
She like to put the top down and tell me "Let 'em see"
She like to leave the doors up, they look like referees
She like to throw it back until she got back pains
She got her own little special contact name

Me, her, plus another bitch, she don't care if the math change
Yeah, I just poured a whole deuce inside a 16
Got her reppin' suwoo, she reppin' big Bs
And she ain't worryin' 'bout fuckin' on a private plane
And she don't do the phone thing, she do the finer things
It's all about deserving things and not designer things
She all about her certain ring and not all kind of rings
All about the sure things and not the shiny things
Man, she so tired of swervin' niggas, need a tire chain
All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night we can't recall it
She lay down and close her eyes, fall asleep open hearted
She done died and went to heaven, I forgot to close the coffin
I'm just lookin' for lil' sexy to direct me from the sorrow
They ain't promisin' tomorrow but she promise to be loyal
So I promise to be faithful, but I'm prolly not gon' chase you
Sit down on my dinner table, eat that pussy like it's catered

You can scratch yo' goals off and you can thank me
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean"
I just told my main thing "Since you my main thing
Let them have the fame thing 'cause it's the same thing
You can take them clothes off and let that thang breathe
Hold me as I doze off, you know I drank lean"

Got her smokin' rapper weed, tryna spit Vs
She been goin' 30 minutes, she just switched knees
Uh, pimpin' ain't easy but it's necessary
Pimpin' ain't dead, check the cemetery
If I tell you that I love you, I ain't lying girl
So worry 'bout yourself and not the other bitch I'm tellin'
All I ever wanted was to tell her she was all I ever wanted
Wake up to her every morning, last night was all recorded
Every day she catchin' feelings, every night I throw a party

Weezy F. Baby, believe that
Haha, yeah

Or I might do the Spurs, sitting on them Tim Duncans
And in that Lamborghini I do donuts like Dunkin's
How come every bad bitch with a pussy wanna fuck him?
But I just feed 'em drugs and just watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was a hundred and my wrist was another

Baby girl getting straight dick, no cuddle

From the side, like Spike at the Garden
I got the hardest bars, call me the warden

I break a bitch down like Tonya Harding
Bitch, I'm col', not dude off Martin
Pockets just fat like the Klumps and Norbit
Bitch, I'm fly like a magic carpet
And bitch, I'm fresh like a pack of Orbit
See, I'mma take it and go bring it back to New Orleans
And bitch, I'mma shine in the land of darkness
In which I'mma grind 'til my stacks is tall as a wall is
And I'm high, don't wanna know how deep the fall is
No, I can't come down
And every time I send my girl out of town
I put some keys on that bitch, I'm a certified gangsta
Haters make me nauseous, the money make me anxious
Listen how my words are poetic like Langston
Dreads down my back like I come straight from Kingston
But I come from Hollygrove, seventeen, danger zone
So many C-notes, I can sing a song
T-top coupe, looking like a thong
Your girl love my dick, she treats it like a bong
I don't wanna be right if gettin' high is wrong
My eyes so low, I look like I'm from Hong Kong
Boy, I got more green than the Bishop Don Juan
OK, I'm not a rookie, I'm a pro — methazine fiend
Make the homies say ho, and make all the girlies scream
I am a vegetarian, man, I only eat beats
Wear a lot of carats, and I smoke the best greens
No beef in my grocery bag
Just some Swishers and a whole bunch of cans of whoop-ass, ha
I'm strapped, like a bookbag
So anyone of y'all can come on and get a foot tag
D.O.A
Ride all night; sleep, no way
Sleep when I lay
Six feet deep, and until that day

I'm not thirsty, baby, I'm allergic
Colder than a hockey jersey, dirty like Kentucky Derby
I was lying on a gurney, I don't wanna die early
I was screaming "Fuck the world," you was singin' "Like a Virgin"
Never be concerned or worried, 2 girls, like Laverne and Shirley
Wake up in the morning early, tell 'em that I love 'em dearly
They say "Oh my God, have mercy," shinin' like I got on Jergens
You can hear my diamonds screaming like they just met God in person
Oh my God the squad alerted, I confirm it
They hop up like Kermit, come to bless you like a sermon
My house lit like Pee-Wee Herman's and you know I bought it furnished
I'm determined like attorneys, y'all lil boys ain't got attorneys
I just hope she not a burden, I just hope she got a purpose
That first week was power surgin', oh my God, the socket workin

Everytime I try to fuckin' order something, uh, you know what I mean, if it got two extra fuckin' screens that you gotta go through, I’m straight. You know what I mean, it’s just too much. Probably gotta be the same button to pressed to accept the shit, or deny the shit. I wouldn’t know

I hate to love, they love to hate, but when it's all synchronizin'
It feel just like the flames have died up in this cold state of mind
Promethazine tranquilizers as I say my goodbyes

But everything is so coolYea... Yea
Yes
Ima call this here... real rap
Cause this rap is real... ya know?
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know you ain't never too live to die
Listen
I grew up where them people called them people on us
Think we slangin, but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Livin' like the videos write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they put cement on us
Ghetto birds still shittin on us, government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies and the grief still sittin on us
So we got the names writtin on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitch ass police canines, teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy roll the L
Beezy ain't here... where's Beezy at?... Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back wit my nigga
But I know thats how it happened my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin my nigga
But now they all rappin, my niggas, so now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sail boat flappin my nigga
No fingas I'm snappin', happy for my nigga Lil' Tiggas
Cause even though we couldn't, The Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Found his body like a month later, Rest in Peace boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wesy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin, and I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin the flow
So if I cry dont stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped the beat
My nigga Lil' Derrick is quick to cop a key
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his mama fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time
I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
Cause if my thoughts got to me I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can, thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yea
And fuck a man with a badge
Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The five o killed naughty good boy dead
Man you woulda thought they killed corn bread
Shot 'em up face down on the lawn
Not to mention with his handcuffs on
Not to mention they had plain clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But don't nobody do nothin' bout it
The jailhouse and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And haters at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin iPod
Shit and they tried to burn my phantom up
But I got my gun license, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera
Stay still mothafucka I'mma have to write my will this summer
Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yea
And you can put that on my late father
Or my late grandmother, Ms. Mercedes Carter
Or my grandfather Larry Bosock
The old man hustle 'till his heart stopped
And all I know 'bout my real pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yea he might hit me off wit a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out I hope he glad for me
But thats why when I see him I acts mad funny -
Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama how it's suppose to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope for me
And I don't ever want to see her mope for me
Hopefully, but truthfully there is a day that's due for me
But we gone pray it's as far as the future sees
You are listenin' to the future Wee-zy F. Baby
AmenLadies and gentlemen, people with jobs, people without jobs

Wizzle Fizzle, original Hot Bizzle

Ride around in Bentley coupes
Got no needs, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
Swimming in Polo, sleeping in Jordans
I bought her cell phone and I don’t even much call it
New imports make her feel important
No bullshit, nigga, no Ben Gordon
Get her information, take her on vacation
Give her dope dick, now she under the sedation
Wake her in the morning, breakfast where she slept at
Tell her go shopping, I can't wait til she get back
Louis flip-flops and a pair of pink sweat pants
She wear that on my jet, I fuck her after jet lag
I take her to the vet cause she a bad bitch
You can't be broke and happy, so me, I'm madd rich
I'm talking Young Money shit, she love the way I think
L’Oreal all over my bathroom sink
Betsey Johnson all over my bedroom counter
My pockets too deep, I fuck around and drown her
Fucking on Versace, napping on satin
I love to hit it backwards: call it pig latin
I bought her ass a Mac, now we be iChattin
Nigga swag-jackin', but I got my patent
Fresh out the salon, I took her to Milan
I speak a little French and her's is no better then mine
I pass her the blunt, she probably hit it one time
Catch us at the game sitting on the baseline
We can call a timeout, take a lil time out
Pockets too deep, shorty, you gonna have to climb out
Faviana prom dress with your spine out
And I live on the beach, you can get that panty line out
She wants to own me and I ain't trying to fight it
She said it's her dick, she got it copyrighted
And I don't pay for pussy because her pussy's priceless
I go fishing in it, and I ain’t a Pisces
Gucci only to the grocery store
Stop playing, bitch, you balling like Okafor
And now we headed to the dealer
I'm going to cop my baby something with no ceilingsMula! Yeah, look
I'ma tell you all this last time, don't get involved
Bullets start ripping through the walls
Hit ya baby mama and the house door
We making house calls, I'm an outlaw, in the south ward
Knock your ass out if you talk stupid
Got a big dick so I walk stupid
She got that hit-it-quick-in-the-car booty
Hold on, bad hoes need to get a raise, lame niggas tryna get away
But all ya diamonds need to get appraised, you in the way
Too many nights I was out lurking, mind in a daze, nowadays
I'm on Ocean Drive with a bad bitch lyin' in the shades
Sipping Minute Maid, gotta penetrate, let me demonstrate
Got the Jones soda with the drink in it
Got a backwood with the dank in it
Party ain't popping if we ain't in it
Go Blake Griffin, might flex on 'em
That's too much sauce, I bet them hoes know who I are
They treat a nigga like a superstar and that's what I am
I got your bitch but that's my bitch
So that's our bitch and that's all cool
When you trip out, wan' dip out, she just call me and I fall through
And that's bad news, hold these nuts, cashews
Vroom, I flew past you, new whips here, what the bags do
Past cool, young Jones
My enemies should get a good breakfast and a cup of coffee
I know refugees that don't rush things, they kill 'em softly
My closet still got Nike boxes and a couple corpses
Look, even though I'll never sell my soul, I got a couple offers
Don't think about it, I smoke about it, I drink about it
They wrap the body, then rap about it
Sink the body, then sing about it, zip the body, then sip about it
Fuck the world, I'ma still get some cool things up out it
If a CEO wanna dance all in my videos, I need a big deposit
Swerve, swerve, I'm back on 'em
My bad, I'm turning my back on 'em
I fuck, then see if Tune, Jay Jones, Hoody, or Mack want 'em
Real shit, I've seen good girls go to airports with that pack on 'em
Trill shit, I've seen bad bitches with good genes but I slack on 'em
I ain't focused there, Gotham City, got Batmans and Jokers there
I'm in the club but I'm in the cut
They got cameras here like Oprah's here
Since a kid, I heard gunshots, mothers cry, all the shit soldiers hear
So I had to "abracadabra," "voila," just to make hope appear
Young!
Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Told momma, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two and I'm out
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Mama, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two, and I'm out, voila!
Magic dust, yeah that's a rush
Got her cracking up, crying all at once, man, that was fun
I'm spazzing up, I'm gassing up that Cali stuff, that massacre
I'm magical with chemicals and smashing stuff, Metallica
Satanical like Skeletor, you greener than a salad bar
I leave from here to Africa to read some Maya Angelou
Impractical, you acting all DiCaprio; we trap and go for casserole
We back and forth in traffic with that Macklemore
That magic snow, it's always cold and my freak on that molly water
I met this bitch on Collins but she out the hood, her mama cook
I'm on the way, I'm on a stage, the Magic show, I feel like Dave
I walk on water, float in air, I'm over there, I'm in your face
I pop up out of nowhere, bop-bop at your doorbell
Disappear in thin air, all we leave is smoke there
Smoking roadkill, she on coke here
Stash is sticking to her nosehair
I'm a magician in the motel, moving tricks for wholesale
Hold on, abracadabra, the data don't matter
We rata-ta-ta-ta over the chatter, we got mo ammo than grammar
Hammers and hammers, pull up in Lambos
Shoot up the cameras, die in pajamas
Find you with Sam and your wife and your mamas
All in your family, I'm balling like Magic, voila!
Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Momma, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two and I'm out
Voila! Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know I'm too real
Voila! Voila! OVO shorts, high socks
Music is art, Basquiat, niggas is squares, hopscotch
Time out, na-na, I got sauce, you dried out
I'm big boss, you big mouth, magic show, don't miss out, voila!
What haven't I done yet?
I haven't Bungee jumped, err, haven't been to Mount Everest, err, take that back, I've probably have been to Mount Everest. Probably flown over it, probably rolled past it and it just was twisted, you nah mean?  That's real shit, real shit, real shit. Holla at my friends, they will let you know slime has sat down and probably ate with the president, and whatever president it was at the time, totally don't remember, you nah mean? But I do remember, Obama saying my name in a speech, shoutout Obama. But still, what haven't I done yet....release Carter 5Six-Figure...

WeezyHate is temporary, love is necessary
I went from eating pussy to eating commissary
Damn, I am the sickest, I need therapy
You can buy the answers but you can’t afford to question me
First off I don’t need you second guessing me
Jail is like third base: I’m coming home eventually
Still got shooters like hot tubs
Man I'm anemic: still got bloods
I’m in my cell reading fan mail
Wish I was in Amsterdam sipping Amstel
Thinking bout all of that pussy I can’t smell
Man they did me wrong; I feel like Nelson Mandel’
I shine too hard my lamp fell
My name still ringing: Alexander Graham Bell
I know you met damn, cause you know damn well
That I still got you open, open like a clam shell
Yeah, still fly on my hawk shit
My conversation stinks cause I talk shit
Stay in your lane you’re on that double-park shit
We eating at the top, get a spoon and a forklift
I got rap wrapped up like a gift
I’d be sober if if was a fifth
I’m feeling like Elvis – jailhouse rock
I’m not 2Pac, I’m the New Pac
Behind bars but the bars don’t stop recording over the phone
I hope the call don’t drop
Drizzy got the ball and I know the ball won’t drop
And I pray none of my kids never wanna be cops
Young Money get ‘em, Young Money got ‘em
The boss got his feet up, vacation on an island
Yeah and tell your girls send the kite up
And even if you don’t smoke motherfucker you gon’ have to light upI don't like the look of it
Okay, I'm sippin on the syrup, got a nigga movin slow
I'm all about the money, what the fuck you think I do it for?
Bitch don't act like you don't know, I'm killin all these rap niggas
Custom made caskets for yo' motherfuckin funeral
Keep the women with me, shit I gotta keep like two or more
Party everyday, like we won the fuckin Super Bowl
Chillin wit my nigga Mack, he keep bitches handy
White girl on the table, let 'em sniff the nose candy
When I'm walkin by, the women sayin, "Who is that nigga?"
I replied, "Hi, I am Gudda Gudda, that nigga!"
I was raised in the home of the cap splitters
Whip on 24's, watch it crawl like a caterpillar
I come with a toy boy like a Happy Meal
And you's a motherfuckin duck, Daffy Dill
I'm from the school of hard knocks, where we scrap and kill
Pick the knife or gun or you can get the package deal
I'm hot nigga, burnin everything around me
I was lost for a minute, took a while but I found me
The streets say I'm king but the game'll never crown me
Realest nigga doin it just ask the niggas 'round me
So you cain't size me up or try to clown a-
Shark in the water, jump in and I'mma drown ya
New Orleans nigga, gun out, I'mma down ya
Put niggas to sleep like a muthafuckin downer
I'm a Great White, you'se a flounder
Fish and a bitch, I tuna eveything around ya
U-Haul Gudda, movin everything around ya
It's Young Money, bitch! At the top is where they found us, nigga
Uh, goons on deck, Marley don't shoot 'em
Silence on the gun, watch a nigga mute 'em
The coach in the booth, call me Jon Gruden
School these niggas, they all my students
All jokes aside, I ain't playin with ya
The weed broke down, like a transmission
Tha chopper spin him 'round, like a ballerina
Bitch I'm still spittin like I ate a jalapeno
I'm from uptown, my bitch from Argentina
My pockets on fat like Joey Cartagena
Stunt so hard, it's all y'all fault
And when it come to beef, give me A1 Sauce
I ain't worryin 'bout shit, everything paid out
You could catch me courtside in Dwayne Wade house
With a high yellow thick bitch wit her legs out
Cash Money president, but we in a red house
Who the fuck want it? Make my fuckin day
I blow your candles out, now nigga cut the cake
I gotta eat, bitch! Like a runaway
Y'all niggas ain't eatin, stomach ache
Okay, all these bitches, and niggas still hatin
I used to be ballin, but now I'm Bill Gatein
Fuckin with my iPhone, bumpin' Illmatic
I'm on the road to riches, there's just a lil' traffic
Hair still platted, thuggin is a habit
Keep my guitar, hip hop Lenny Kravitz
Bunch of bad bitches and I fuck 'em like rabbits
Dope dick Weezy, ya girlfriend an addict, uhYeah yeah yeah

I'ma show y'all the ins the outs, the ups the down, know what I'm talking 'bout
This is me, fourth solo album baby, I came back around
By myself this time, back off the wall
Guns up in the air in the middle of the street like bang, bang, bang bang, welcome
Welcome, this is the Carter y'all welcome
Hard as Malcolm, dark as The Falcon, Lord help him
But y'all felt him, and that make you a part of me and pardon me
If a part of me is what you wanna be what you oughta be
Doing, recording me, I'm just acting accordingly, I give orders
To the commander in chief, just the commander in me
Handling streets in the Mandarin V
I hear you haters slandering me, I just hand 'em to P
Any drama, I pace it like Indiana
I take your grandma pacemaker and just hand her the piece
Not two fingers I simultaneously pop two bangers
You do not want angus, USDA prime beef, you're dead meat
I'm so ahead of these trendy rappers speed up
I'm already hot when another one starting to heat up
Got Mannie hot with me cuz I always beat his beat up
Y'all cats wit y'all feet up starting to look like V'd up
I'm G'd up on the re-up up, in the truck I gotta put my seat up
In the trunk I got my bass and I ain't speakin about no speakers
What's leaking up out of your speakers is the speech of Weezy F. Baby
No more no less Baby, so forth and so on, 
Front door, living room young nigga switching weed
What you need? Get you crack, get you weed
Make your way to the back, look ahead and see
White bitch in the bathroom giving head for speed
But don't you turn your head at me, the president been doin it
Then he tried to ruin it, but I built this building from the ruts
I own all the corners and the cuts in this motherfucker
And the feds know just what's in this motherfucker
Made niggas so they can't bust in this motherfucker
So with that, let's keep it movin'
Onto the kitchen where my witches keep it brewin'
Uh huh, look at how my bitches do it
Bucky buck naked, look at all my bitches booties
They handle all my pharmaceutics
I got it from Promethazine to Metamucil
I'm crucial, don't mean to spook you
But, this is New Orleans, so my queens do voodoo, ya know?
So the things just move through
I feel your pain, I got things to soothe you
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution
There's fields of 'caine, so Wayne and neutral
Don't hate the game hate the institution, fucker
I came back around, it's the Carter
Show you the rest of the house later
We gonna go upstairs, ya know
You know what this is right
The Carter, the Carter, the CarterCome on, come on, come on, come
Shout for the 17, shout for the Hollygrove
Shout for the 17
I'mma take it uptown, uptown
You dig
You understand me
Woke one morning
Tears in my eyes
And you had left me without a kiss or a note
Or goodbye
Now I got to learn to live alone
But my heart can't take it
I guess that's why I wait by the phone
For a call, a call from you
Sayin' she needs me back
Just as much as I need you
But I guess for the time, you need to stay away
Let me tell you baby, now I'm thinkin' of you every day
I'm thinkin' about you
I'm thinkin' about you
Oops upside your head
I said oops upside your head
I said feet, don't fail me now
White man came down to my city
On the corner
And asked me what do I do
I said, do what I wanna
Said, do what I wanna
I keep thinkin' 'bout the good times we had
And how we let jealousy
Turn all we had good into bad
Now I realize

Throwing up fingers, saying, “My side rule”
If a nigga disagree, that’s what my side prove
That Maybach Coupe a cock-eyed fool
And I’m in it like Bennett, ho, aren’t I cool
But if the thermostat switch and that needle move

Cock the semi
Drop you like an Otterbox
They sleeping on me like I'm rapping with a blanket
Kill a nigga, have him thinking that he planking
All-red plaid shirt, skinny ass jeans on
Them goons at your front door, choppers out: "ding dong
Didn't I change the game and put my motherfucking team on
Now let my chopper ring, blaka is my ringtone
Fuck you ho-ass niggas, I get money and get over hoes
We hold court with them heaters, pop case open/closed
Looking for a bitch to hop up on my totem pole
And my blunt be stupid-fat, double-stuffed Oreos
I get loaded til I motherfucking overload
Been rapping, flows still tight like aerobic's clothes
Ask them bitches, I told em hoes
They back it up like Sonny drive in Bronx Tale, Calogero
Lighter in my pocket, light the sky rocket
Pull them hammers out and run them nigga's like stockings
Got some niggas from my city
Thugga, Dizzy, Flow
Sorry for the Wait, coming soon, Carter IV, beyotchNo ceilings
No ceilings

Sippin' Barney, smokin' Baby Bop
She's performing on the table top
Steph Curry, boy, I'll take the shot 
Then I'll pull off and wave goodbye
I'm ready for the war, I'm not afraid to die
My niggas wild like Omega Psi
My bitches screamin' "Ooh-la-la"
I tell my demons "Kumbaya"
Them sticks go "Boo-ya-ka"
Make a nigga say "Uhh na-na-na-na-na"
I got money on my mental
Got them niggas in my rear view
I'm a dog, I'm a dog
Rottweilin' on these Shih tzu's
Drop dollars on your temple
Pop collars like a pistol
Drive back and forth for codeine
Put some mileage on the rental
Money talks like Jimmy Kimmel
Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno
I'm straight N.O., the U-N-O
Fast life, so uptempo
Ooh-wee, Presidential
In the Backwood, eating Mentos
Smoke that loud like crescendos
Rep the Mob like De Niro
Fucking like a nympho

Smoking on that kill though
Got me happier than Gilmo'

Smoking bog and sipping Lakers

With my niggas in this bitch
They like "Fuck it Lucci, get 'em"
I'm from that East side of New Orleans

And all the hoes want ballers

Still no job – bitch, I ain't hurtin'
Put a ho on the stroll and told her "Get to workin'"
She dropped a Xanny in his drink, the Rolly in her purse
Then brought it back to Daddy, man I swear this pimpin' work
I pop the clutch and hit the gas, I love the way it skrrt
She popped a bean and poppin' ass, can't keep it in her skirt
I beat it up, she eat it up, no feelings
It's Lucci Lou and Tunechi, nigga, no ceilings
No ceilings, bih, like an astronaut
Turk and Wayne back at it, nigga, we ain't gon' stop
Thuggin' nigga, it's thug life, 2Pac
My youngin with me, they stay strapped with two Glocks
I'm Molly turnt, but so uptown, throwing threes up like slime
Pussy nigga keep hating on me, keep hating, I ain't got time
Too busy chasing this paper, got money on my mind
Fuck you and your favors, know you seen my grind
I kicked the habit, never thought I could
That shit had me since fourteen
I was shooting up, nigga, on tour, fucking up my dreams
Fucking off my green, fucking off with these hoes
Could've died over a million times, I swear only God knows
Now I'm back nigga, like a hungry dog at the doorstep, let's eat

Young veteran, soon to be OG
Plus I spit like a crackhead with no teeth

You like a nigga with no guns, you gets no peace
And when it comes to money my shit is obese
Like Della Reese, I need celery
More money, what the fuck these niggas telling me?
I'm young Lucifer, take em all to hell with me, yeah
Drop 'em off in a fire storm, YM riot squad, get our riot on
If he testify like Common, see the fire bomb
If you know what's best, mothafucka, get your quiet on
These niggas starving out here getting they diet on
While I'm eating, nigga, gripping on my styrofoam
One man game, nigga, I'ma die alone
For now, I'm with your girl, getting my Rowdy Roddy Piper on
Willie the Kid, pull guns like a hamstring
No bull, I push Pro-Vs like Pantene
Blow like a trombone, funny niggas, tambourine
Players get jumped like a trampoline, tangerine
Gators day, nay-sayers, mascara wearers
And my niggas on paper, getting paper like ballplayers
No blood no foul, yeah, my heart cold as Moscow
We nap ya kin like a hot towel 
All my hoes hostile, not me, never tell me "not now"
Rap niggas, forty-cal. to your brow 
Roof-remover, we leave your brain with more air
Maneuver, I leave your bitch with a moist chair 
Seduce her, yeah, you rappers should be tired of lyin'
But I know it's hard like a tire iron
But yet it's complex, like it's Mayan science
Or Aztec math, I'm crazy as a mesc' tab
I feed niggas like a mess hall
And yes, y'all, It's Willie, how I address y'all
Or like a stylist, nobody's fly as this

They say powder makes you hyper, reefer makes you calm
Cigarettes give you cancer, woo-woos make you dull
While I sip the purple harlot, thick as my Southern drawl
Put me on the ocean floor wit a mermaid wit no draws
They got bats up in the cave, upside-down
Blood rushing to they head, they reacting off sound
As I stand on the mound, pitching for the crown
Uptown-bound, face painted like a clown
Reciting scriptures from the chapters, Proverbs, Leviticus
Old-ass rappers complaining what the business is
'Bout the state of hip, soundin like some bitches
Hop your ass up off a rich nigga dick, it's ridiculous
The new school nigga, what you need to do is become a resident
Under conditions, get your ass up off your ass
And get your ass up on a mission, become some competition
Like Federer and Nadal, Young Money, nigga, we ball
Like Kobe or Chris Paul, forgiving a wack cracker
Still sipping Cristal, waving the lifeline
Since life's a bitch, y'all, raising up the skirts of Jezebels
For no cash, like, "Bitch, gimme that ass"
Or pulling up to the lot like, "Gimme that Jag'"
No, pulling up to the lot like, "Gimme that Lam'"
They study me, yeah, they cram, like I'm a final exam
If I hit you in your back, tou'll need a spinal exam
I'm something like a rhino or ram, animal, beast
Irritating you pussies like chlamydia, yeast
YM militia, you niggas better retreat
Or be like this beat, R.I.P., deceased
'Cause I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
Yeah, I'ma kill 'em, yes, I'm kill 'em
And I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
I'ma kill 'em 
Yeah, already, you better call every pallbear-ier in y'all area
The ball carrier gon' get popped, if I'm coming around the block The in-swing drive gets stopped, he gon' drop like a flop
On the court, I love sports, that's why I play my bitches
'Cause I got game, that's why you pay my bitches, yeah
Same hustle, new money
I'm just hip-hopping like two bunnies 
Who run it? Bitch nigga, moi
That was French, nigga, not a kiss, nigga, nah
Ha, no homo, rappers get ate like four and four
They say I fucked so-and-so
And I be like "So, so and so"
Nikes on they neck, they like, "Let me breathe"
I'm sorry, but I can't, this is how we feed 
This is why we hot, this is how we freeze
Too fast to follow, this is why we lead
And the money in the pocket isn't why we Gs, see
This is how we shoot and this is how we leave 
You know we tote steel, this is how we ease
You can get the steel if you try these thieves, now
Pass me the Swisher, let me climb these trees
And them haters say we couldn't, this is why we bes
This shit like pudding, putting it down
Like gravity's pulling, putting it down
Like gravity's pulling, putting it down
Like gravity's pulling me to the ground

Your hate don't impact us
Our bitches' dick-grabbers

Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain’t got a whole team right

He said I should give it up cause he got money
Told him I don’t think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya
All of my niggas is real, all of my niggas is solid
All of my money is in rubber bands, I do not carry a wallet
All of my bitches stay ready, soon as I walk in she gon pop it
Everyday I be floating, forever on autopilot
If that nigga ain’t got my money though
Wrap him up like a mummy though
Regular wolves howl at the moon
My wolves come out when it’s sunny though
My niggas ain’t got no words with police
You tell the cops what they wanna know
This shit right here is my dummy flow
No Ibaka but I bring that thunder though
Your girl a jumpoff, I holler "Geronimo"
Slam in that pussy like dominos
That boy Millz he got beats and all kinds of flows
What you think Weezy signed me for?
Stayed down and I’m still down
True definition of loyal

From birth to now, heart Big like L, Notorious, and Pun
I want what I deserve, and some

All my niggas outside with me
All my niggas down the ride with me
And every freak that that I ever meet
Gotta fuck my girl if she slide with me
That’s word
Oh it’s way past midnight
Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain’t got a whole team right
Yeah ahh
He think that he gone take it from me
He said I should give it up cause he got money
Told him I don’t think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet ya
We kick down the door, said it before
We did not come round to play games with you niggas
They say you nobody til somebody kills ya
Well I’m bout to make you a famous lil nigga
No game in this killer, murder he wrote
Can get life behind bars with these murderous quotes
The flow is like meth, it’s like crack, it’s like heroin
Yes I am spitting this dope
I am the future, I’m seeing right through you
I’m so New Orleans but I do not know voodoo
My piece will come face-to-face with you like Oovoo
Have niggas searching for you like it’s Google, I’m brutal
I’ve been slept on for a long time
Been patient for a minute, now I want mine
I hear a lot of niggas talking down
I’ma put my mothafuckin foot where the sun don’t shine
Can’t rhyme in a cypher like this
I’ve been rockin with the best
They don’t put me on the list
I’m an underground king
Underrated in the streets favorite
Every street corner gonna speak bout this
Rest in peace Pimp C
Still got the muddy cup full of Morgan Freeman
Yep, lean on me
Like Wu Tang, cash rules everything around me
You know I got the cream on me
Gun barrel smoking like hydro
Middle fingers up, fuck five-o
Still repping B's like a H-town nigga
When I’m finished in this bitch call Geico
You looking at a god man, I put that on the Bible
Killin’ everything fuck rivals
Hundred round drum on the stick
When I let the bitch off man it sound like pyro
Oh it’s way past midnight
Shadows in them streetlights
Gotta trap for them niggas tryna act like
A bitch ain’t got a whole team right
Yeah ahh
He think that he gone take it from me
He said I should give it up cause he got money
Told him I don’t think that I can please ya
But I got a bunch of killas wanna meet yaI tell her "now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
I tell her "go on! Pop that pussy for me"
Haters can't see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about "I" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'mma have em checkin pulses
They say "choose wisely" that's why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Pandemonium, she cause that
Toss it up, and I stuff 'em where her draws at
That's on everything like feets that's on my floor mats
Red bottoms, spikes on 'em, that's dos stacks
Speakin' Spanish while she tannin', body no fat
Shawty body body got me on my 4th stack
Pink champagne, order Moët
Rollin' airplanes, where I land at?
I levitate over numbers you niggas never make
The Columbians callin', I tell 'em "perate"
Every summer I celebrate with a new estate
Let's get the fuck out this club, call it the great escape
She wrap her lips 'round a nigga, just like a chinchilla
Crap table Bellagio, I'm a big tipper
My life a stage I need her just to stand on it
Every time she look back, I toss a band on it
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she willYeah, yeah, yeah
Weezy Baby, y'all
Don't get shot
Rapid fire, what you know bout it?
I brought my homie along for the ride
He strapped, he getting ready to come out the back room
Rob!
]
I heard some shouts, like, "Down on the floor!" 
Then—even louder—"We got shooters , shooters! "
I turn around, I was staring at chrome 
Shotgun watches door, got security good 
Jumped right over counter, pointed gun at, wink
He tell her, "I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter" 
My hands up , my hands up 
They want me with my hands up
Oh, "Shooter!"
My hands up , my hands up 
They want me with my hands up
Oh, "Shooter!" 
So many doubt cause I come from the South
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out
Bang! Die, bitch-nigga, die! I hope you bleed a lake
I'mma play x-ray, helping y'all see the fake
I'm just trying to be the Great, trying to get a piece of cake
Take it off of your plate, eat it right in your face
They got a whole lot to say but I don't listen
Call me Automatic Weezy, bitch, I keep spittin', pow!
All these bitches and, all these bitches!
But ain't no lovers around
They thinking about shooting! Them shooters
Got the guns, girls. Ladies, them gunners that
Shoot shoot shoot shoot! Shooters!
My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, "shooter!"
My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, "shooter!"
And to the radio stations, I'm tired of being patient
Stop being rapper racists, region-haters
Spectators, dictators, behind door dick-takers
It's outrageous! You don't know how sick you make us
I want to throw it up like chips in Vegas
But this is Southern, face it
If we too simple, then y'all don't get the basics
Lady walks into a shotgun surprise
Dropped to her knees, saw her life before her eyes
He said: "bitch is gonna get it, everybody gon' regret it
I'm your - shooter!"
My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, "shooter!"
Socks soaking wet, I been running y'all, I reload
Every hundred yards, I'm comin' forward
You better know me, Lil Wayne, just call me Lord, hard
Take pain like Tylenols, raw, way past par
Far, I'm some shit you never saw
I take you to the shootout, baby, win, lose, or draw
And then they ask who, when, where, how, and
My reply was simply, "Pow!" C'mon!
Mama, I tink dat, ay!
Me tink dey want me to surrender!
No! No, I'm sayin'
Mama, I tink dey, ay!
Me tink dey want me to surrender!
No, no, me won't surrender
No, no, I promise no surrender
I got my burner
And I'm the shooterMichael Phelps, this for you, baby!
I'm goin' for the gold, my heart is in control
My mind is on succeed and I am in the lead
Don't buy into the schemes, the science or strategy
Just giant N-U-Ts brings triumph and belief
I'm a lion or a dean, inspired by the green
Never tired or fatigued, never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I'm lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things; I'ma die as a king
If I don't do it now, I'ma try it again
And when I do accomplish it, I'ma try it again
I'm a riot, insane; I'm a lion, my mane
Hangs down to my strings and they're tied to the game
I stay dry when it rain, I'm tired of the fame
Got everything to gain and I'm proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane; besides, we're the same
Who's guiding the train? Who's flyin' the plane?
Who's driving the lane? Who dies when it bang?
Who fires when it bang? Who lies in the aim?
Two lives in the drain; who cries when they sang?
You hide but you can't; you high but you ain't
I advise you to think; you'll find what you can't
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank: the fries and the drank
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank
Combined with my strength, my time and my length
I'ma iron out the kinks; yes, I'm on the brink
And in the eye of my wink, I'ma retire in the bank
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy's misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively; you can't harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually; you'll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of "this is what you did to me"
Nothin's what you did for me, nothin's what you give to me
I take whatever I'm visualizing, now break all of the limiting
Now shake all of the gimicking, the fakery, the trickery
"Nurse, how sick is he?" "Worse, I am sickening!"
I'll be at the finish line first, "how quick is he?"
I'ma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain't with the bickering, I am full of dignity
I am full of energy, pull out the inner me
Or bull after dinner meat, I stood in the winter heat
It could be the end of me, but good be defending me
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
I'm allergic to cheatin'
I hate failure and I'm in love with achievement
Above and beneath it, a hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize and I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin', begun with the preachin'
Now pray, until I am one with the deacon
Now play, until I have won whatever we win
I play, until I have won, and then I re-win
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go gettaIt's kinda hard saying this shit to your face

She gets high sometimes
'Cause I'm always doin' it
You hear them hallways

Every time feel like the first one
Perfect
When a nigga stressin' at work
She take away all of the pain
Make it lesser than dirt

I'mma good lookin’ rapper I ain't tryin’ to stuntMoolah babe
She was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame
She would do anything she could to feel the flame
When everybody know your move and the things you pay
She finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! 
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
You know, this ain't paradise
He was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame
And he would do anything he could to kill the pain
When everybody know your moves, they speak of your name
And oh, all over the late night local news I heard him scream
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! 
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
You know, this ain't paradise
Woah
I say the sun don't shine forever 
And everything that glitter ain't gold 
I say love don't love forever 
And everything that's new gets old 
Sometimes we try to find the road to the riches
Need roadside assistance
Blisters on my knees, from beggin' for forgiveness
Ain't no dollars on my trees, but mileage on my feet
'Cause I been climbin' to the peak, and runnin' from the bullshit
I'm tired of playin' the same song, who told the DJ bring it back?
Dead Presidents, bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat
Starin' at big poster, I swear that he be winkin' back
Cut school, sell crack, sorry I'm just thinkin' back
Call me crazy, I've been called worse
It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?
Ha ha, I'm probably better in my afterlife
I should cherish life, but this just ain't paradise
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!
Oh no, this ain't paradise! 
This ain't paradise; no, this ain't paradise
This ain't paradiseBirds flying high you know how I feel
Birds  flying high, you know how I feel
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Birds  flying high, birds flying high
Smoking all day drinking on hard liquor
I stay high, even high in this song nigga
Im on silver haze what is you chiefin?

Tangled in the grip-lock
And will I ever stop? never that

Looking for ur boy, im probably crawling on the ceiling
Fallin on the railing catch me im gone

Like arrivederci, all hail the king
The city on his shoulder like barbell on strings
But ain't no place like home
That rope ain't too long and they gon' pull it off
The king want his crown back, he never took it off

Gotta get it gotta have it
Once I got it I'mma spend it
Then its back to doing any damn thing just to get it

If I ain't say it right fuck it I ain't foreign
Feel me
And see thats where everybody get me wrong at, you know what I mean?
I got that heat rock, foreal
Why do you think other rappers lack the impact of your music?

The back of Tha Carter, yeah

Uhg, yeah
This here is
The end of Tha Carter Two, people
Hey, yeah
I got the game
On ball and chain
I threw the key in the drain
I'm like a ki in a drought
I spent a G on these frames
But my vision is priceless
Seeing through you niggas
Like a fuckin' psychic
Hearing through the grapevine
Niggas wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime
You catch my drift
Man you better be Peyton
Boy the heat's on
They making peace bonds
I'm in this bitch throwing up the "17" sign
Straight frowns, no daps
Strapped three times
A Tec-11, AK-47, one Beretta
Ready for whatever
Tell them pussy niggas come together
Heavy better, nigga
Super-soaker wet a nigga
Six feet under flowers
You ain't nothing but a petal, nigga
I'm just a little nigga
Trying to be a civil nigga
30 years old, shit
That'll be a given, nigga
Quit it Wayne, your Mom is listening
But she ain't really tripping
'Cause the pots is pissed in
Them niggas trippin'
Until the shots whistlin'
Hear them bullets hissin'
Like a cobra at attention
I got a bitch, and quit calling women bitches
As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventing the grind, I gotta get it
I'm admitted to the game, true player, no quittin'
There you go shittin' on the way a nigga thinkin'
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
And since the future ain't promised to no one
I live everyday like this is the sure one
Trade in the tidal wave, this is the ocean
Stand in that heat 'til the motherfucking snow come
And it feels so fucking good
Throw my dope like a rope
Let 'em tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless
Rats and roaches
Running 'cross the porch
In the attic there's a fortune
Come and get it
Automatics in motion
We banging for the bread
Nigga, even the molded
I got my loaf
I got my toast
Chaperone of the South
I got my coast
Yeah, and until I die
I'm the Best Rapper Alive got a haircut
Mu in this bitch, Scoob in this bitch with me
So much shit on my mind, I just hope I don't smell like it
The motherfuckers pointing fingers
Be the same ones that have nail bitin'
Real niggas, still real niggas, you new niggas, just lil' niggas
When ya shit fall, don't be surprised
Acting like you didn't hear timber
I'm caffeinated, I'm half-sedated
I started from the bottom, I gravitated
I'm validated, I'm a trigger happy nigga
And it's sad to say it, but I had to say it
I had to do it, I had to stunt, act like I had what I had for once
With all of my thank yous added up
I still can't thank Birdman enough, I woke up in a new Tyra Banks
I've been gettin' money since Shabba Ranks
The car I'm in brand spankin' new, it just got spanked
Real niggas say rest in peace to DJ Screw
Rest in peace to Pimp C too
Fuck your bulletproof vest  I still need proof, my nigga
I hate you like mustard, I'm disgustin'
I'm aiming at your chest, hit your face, I'm just rusty
Cherish every step that we take, some of us clumsy
Lookin' for a breath of fresh air, it's hidin' from me, fuck
Mall roll it up in the leaf, weed stronger than Zangief
I last longer than an antique, her pussy cummin' like a stampede
She cooks, fucks and clean, the type of bitch that every man need
The type of bitch that every man leave
That ain't cool, and she wearin' sleeves, but chill, just chill
Girl, you gotta chill, uh, I just gotta tell you how I feel, yeah
Girl, you gotta chill, uh, you know that I'll always keep it real
You just need to chill, oh, oh
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill 
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill 
Yeah, girl, you gotta chill
You could fuck all these bitches, except my bitches
Yeah right, I wish, with all three wishes
Man I swear she got too attached, had to cut the umbilical
Man I swear I'm so armed, I feel like I got tentacles
Niggas bumpin' their gums, I feel like Orajel
Got 'em scratchin' their head, combin' out broken nails
See I give 'em my love, but I'm an indian giver
Got my ear to the streets, I hear the enemy whisper
I break the bank with a sledgehammer
Cellphone rings like Saturn
Bitch let a nigga breathe, breathe like a dragon
I hide money everywhere, that's my hidden talent
One time for them gangstas, fuck that, two times for them gangstas
If you got a problem, I'll fix that like, yeah nigga I'm maintenance
Got a bad bitch and she anxious, bitch, you just an acquaintance
I'll ask a rat, "Why be a rat?" then kill him while he explainin'
Tell your foot soldiers to walk light, handful of real niggas left
And if any nigga wanna step to me tell 'em hurry up and take bigger steps
My bitch deep, I get in depth, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
She dyed her pussy hair red, she said she had to roll the red carpet out
That's real
So real
Yeah, you know that I'll always keep it real
You just need to chill, oh, oh
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill 
I just gotta tell you how I feel, yeah, girl you gotta chill
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill 
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill 
Girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill 
Yeah, girl, you gotta chill, girl, you gotta chill
Girl, you gotta chill
Yeah, Tunechi
Shawty is you gon' ride 'til it's over? 
Man we gettin' high, never sober 
Still ridin' dirty 'til it's over I'm a pimp under pressure, but it's necessary
Treat a bad fish better than a veterinary
Never treat a secondary sweet as February
I could turn a bestie into a adversary
I tried, no, really, really, I tried
Although I'm really, really up, I'm
Still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I, I, got a lot on my mind
To my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say "Why?" I say "Why?"
He say "Damn, my nigga, never mind," oh no
That's why I just get high
I light one and watch time go by, go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
Is it love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
Thought I was done tryna love
I guess I love tryna love, hey
Not so careful, but today, I just don't care
Dye my hair
We so faded, we can't make it up my stairs
We fuck right there
Not so lucky, but tonight, I just crapped out
Vegas sucks, I'm still gambling with her, no protection
Protect what?
'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows?
Nigga, not me
I'm the one she does the most
So when she do the most
At least, the most, at least
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a pimp under pressure, but it's necessary
Treat a bad bitch better than a veterinary
Eat a bad bitch 'less she got that hairy, hairy
I could take her ex out of her vocabulary
I, yeah got a lot on my mind
Tell my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say "Why?" I say "Why?"
He say "Damn, my nigga, never mind," oh no
That's why I just get high
I light one and watch time go by, go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
No, really, really, I tried
Although I'm really, really up, I'm
Still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
We ain't no junkies, but today, we're like Snow White
Whatever we like, she don't judge me
Though I may need her to be the one to give me life
'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows? Not me
I'm the one she does the most
So when she do the most
At least, the most, at least
 Never mind
I, I, got a lot on my mind
To my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say "Why?" I say "Why?"
He say "Damn, my nigga, never mind"Since I've lost you I'm lost too
Niggas feeling like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart too
God knows that I'll do anything for a part 2
Be prayin' for the day you come back to me
Sayin that you forgive me
Give me another chance I'm needing it like a kidney
I don’t want to advance
Give me back her hands give me back her touch
I don’t ask for much, but I fucked up
I know I fucked, I admit I fucked, but everybody fuck up
Now this other nigga lucked up
Tell him me and my clique don’t give a fuck
Cuz um, I'm from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was a soldier
I was a gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster. Bang
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control 
You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top 
But there's something that you forgot
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fights
You can’t tell me you don’t remember those nights
And if I would cry, you would cry twice
To me you were the brightest star under sunlight
Take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life
-Give me back my girl and you give me back my life-
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hoping she’d be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I can bring it back
What she means to me is what I mean to rap
But I hope u haven’t forgot about me
Up in the living room watchin sports center
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the lord is a forgiver
You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Why " Ma you even went and got a tear drop like me "
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me butter, I called you baby
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say, please, don’t worry about the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream. Damn
I shed tears ‘cause I'm told that they’ll heal
To tell the truth I don’t know how to feel
Never felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin
Way back it was hoops, now it’s Maybach coupes
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room I'm laughin, cause it’s lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattood by kartoo?
 by my rules we all lose
Flippin' through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin' pictures of my jewels in the light
Hundred g’s in the night, entertain big timers
Cause my one-liners rule these dynamers
Smellin' Rosé on my breath, an ex-brisco fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin' lavish stackin' mail up
Clothes come from big n tall …………?
Got live life, I'm tryna live life
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the Benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get fifty collect calls from dawgs behind bars
Fortune and fame are pleasures you couldn’t fathom
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin ‘em mighty daily
I know I'm under surveillance 
Millions I gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin I'm such a threat to these n*ggaz 
I started without a coin, not knowin which way I'm goin
Now I'm chatering boeings n readin a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
And I never felt this way bout anything in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure successGirls that don’t do girls, that’s that shit I don’t like
Dick in her mouth, bitch eatin’ her out, that’s that shit my girl like
I’m layin’ back with my feet up, bad bitch: D cups
All I had was one molly and she took half: prenup
I just licked my thumb and thumbed through that pussy like a catalog
All my niggas wanna fuck, and she gon let us like a salad bar
Yeah that’s right, real shit
Murderer I kill kill
Cash Money, cash cow that never cry over spilled milk
I’m way high on the highway, my girl call to get my lies straight
That machine gun go “brrrrr” like I got that bitch on vibrate
Niggas think they hot, I cut off the hand they fan with
Call me DMX, cause I keep me a bad bitch
T called some of them hoes up, Marley G roll up
I’m gettin’ bread like cold cuts, she suck dick till her nose run, yeah
A rich nigga that that shit they don’t like
All you niggas pussies, naw none of yo pussy’s tight
Gettin’ head while I drive make me run lights
These hoes wanna ride my dick you gotta hitchhike
No lie, I’m fuckin’ bitches and gettin’ paid
She suck my dick for 60 seconds and swallow all my Minute Maid
No lie, I’m gettin’ paid and fuckin’ bitches
The Feds on me, gotta switch plates:
In the streets we call that washin’ dishes
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on the nine-milly
T-roll my blunt long as a lifespan then I kill it
Eatin’ pussy, tongue kissin’ and all that
She ridin’ a nigga so fast, my dick feel like it’s been carjacked
Two guns drawn, art class, what that is thats y’all ass
Mo money, mo money, we gettin’ mo like tall grass
We are not one and the same
Blood is the game, you run in my veins
I bagged your bitch then fuck her
Now come get your bitch from baggage claim, nigga!
Dr. Carter, fuck her harder
All my homies bald, nigga

But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And so she's gone to party town, on her own
And you go by yourself, so all alone
I told her I can be with her
But I can't be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much, that's the problem
Oh my god then, shorty be wildin'
And when I say I got to leave
You wouldn't believe all of the things
That she'll do and all of the things
That she'll say to make me stay
And I be like, daaaaaammmmnnnnnn
I been that boy for forever
I'll be back someday
But she wanna go with me to outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way and then I send her on her way
Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
Your like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one
But yourself
And so she's gone to party town
On her own
And you go by yourself

Y'all know that ain't right
Plus he was high as a plane on that same night
Shit I probably been on that same flight
Shit I probably had that same fight
I just kept swinging
Twelve rounds coming, bells ringing
Introduced to the game when I was just a child
Mama loved a drug dealer, straight quit her job
They took his life
And along with him I died
And she died
We died
Then came my daughter to my bedside
Told me "Daddy, don't cry, I'm alive"
I look her in the eyes
And see me with no sins

And my love always free when the lights get dark
I know love isn't cheap I got a nice-ass job
You look priceless to me, I'll rip your price tag off
Baby "Tell me who you loyal to?"
Do you start with the money or the man?
Does it end with your heart in your hand?
Fuck it, if the money bag in the other hand, that was the plan
Let that nigga spoil you
I guess somebody else on grind mode
But a nigga that provide though
Put his pride to the side though, and you my slime, so
Said she really love the blonde look

See, this Dedication mixtape series is so important to the culture because they say it is. It's plain and simple, plain and simple. I don't label it important to the culture. If I have ever labelled it important to the culture I was feelin' myself and smellin' my drawers -- uh, pause -- I'm old, my mama used to always say that, my grandma used to say that "You smellin' your drawers." -- but anyway, I don't know if y'all people say that, I'm from the south -- but yeah, the Dedication mixtape series is important to the culture because the culture say it's important. So that's why I still jump my ass in these motherfuckin' booths, wherever I can find a booth, most likely the same one, and do my motherfuckin' thing. And I gotta keep doing my thing and that's why I do my thing because the culture say it's important. They say "We want that, we need that, we gotta have that." It make the-it make the world know what I mean? It make the music world spin, and that's what it's all about, and it's 'cause they say itDamn, she bad, damn, she thick

You don't need a Superman, you just need a man like Weezy
 And I can make you feel the same way
We can postpone and stay home like a rain day
She'll have the salad, just put her on Wayne's plate
What you know bout having syrup poured on that pancake
Nasty as I wanna be, or nasty as you like me to
Be, I hope you like me too, but now you know I like you too
Three A.M. room service, serve ya
You can be my dessert, be my caramel sherbert
Call your mama, we can make a baby
And the way you work that mic in the video is so 
And that chair or stool move was cool

I could be your future, I could be your teacher
Be your professor, write down this lecture
You want some extra credit? Let me check your homework

Invite yo' friend that's friendly fire
Bitches ain't shit but yours and mine
Ooh, girl I love you so
That's why I always fuck you slow
All these little hoes they come and go
She was just a flame, went up in smoke
And I told myself not to love the bitches
Hard to stop fallin' for a bitch when you trippin'
Hard to stop sleepin' on a bitch when you sippin'
When you sippin'
Can't trust these hoes, can't love these bitches
Then my heart get cold, middle finger with the mittens
Bitches lie through they teeth, I never wanted to be a dentist
Might as well keep spittin', it ain't love it's business

Raj Smoove 
The greatest DJ in the world 
Ooh boy 
We about to say a prayer for all our loved ones
I'mma call this one "Real Rap"
Anybody you lost, put 'em on your heart
Because this rap is real, you know?
Light it up for 'em
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
And I hope you know
You ain't never too alive to die, heh
Listen, I grew up where the people call them people on us
Think we slangin', but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Living like the videos, write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they poured cement on us
Ghetto bird still shittin' on us
Government still quittin' on us
Lost a few homies, and the grief's still sittin' on us
So we got their names written on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitchass police K9's teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy rolled a L
Beezy ain't here — Where's Beezy at? Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back with my nigga
But I know that's how it happened, my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin', my nigga
But now they all rappin', my niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sailboat flappin', my nigga
No fingers, I'm snappin'
Happy for my nigga Lil Tagus
'Cause even though we couldn't, the Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Shit, found his body like a month later
Rest in peace, boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin'
And I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin' the flow
So if I cry, don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped a beat
My nigga Lil Derek was quick to cop a ki
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his momma's fine
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I think about it all the time, I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
'Cause if my thoughts got to me, I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can
Thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yeah, and fuck a man with a badge
'Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The 5-0 killed Naudy, good boy dead
Man, you would've thought they killed cornbread
Shot him up, face down on the lawn
Not to mention, with his handcuffs on
Not to mention, they had plain-clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But nobody do nothing about it
The jail house and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And hate is at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin' iPod
Shit, and they tried to burn my Phantom up
But I got my gun license, haha, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera —
Stay still motherfucker
I'mma have to write my will this summer
'Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yeah, and you can put that on my late Father
Or my late Grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter
Or my Grandfather, Larry Balsock
The old man hustled 'til his heart stopped
And all I know of my real Pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yeah, he might hit me off with a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out, I hope he glad for me
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny
'Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama, how it's supposed to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope from me
And I don't ever wanna see her mope for me
Hopefully, but, truthfully
There is a day that's due for me
But we gon' pray that it's as far as the future sees
You are listening to the future Weezy F. Baby
Amen

You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves

Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again

It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to 
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to 
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to 
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to 
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to, yeah 
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to 
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
Yeah, they don't love you like they used to 
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to, yeah

Cuz you were my brotha and I love ya, and I miss ya
Stay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell ya
He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor
Standing on stage in front of thousands
Don't amount to me not havin my father
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard
I'm alright, God, shit, I'm still breathin
But losses hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleedin
Throw me down some comfort, cause my heart need it
Tryin to cope wit my chances and meet 'em
There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin to take it easy
Rest in peace Lil Beezy, my nigga
 
Though, though I'm missin you

Smoke kush all day and pop painkillers
Fuck who don't understand it, this what the game did us
This what the streets showed us
This how the block made us
The same block where they layed 'em
I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me
Lord, will I be next for the taking? Take me
I know I'm livin like I know when I'm comin
But I'm just livin cause I know that it's comin
And the end is comin, but I ain't runnin
I ain't hidin and duckin
I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it
I'm just speakin from the heart of the dyin' public
We still beatin, we gon rise above it
Though it seem like they cheatin and we losin'
We survive if nothin
They could never take the stride from strugglin
I gotta ride, and sometimes that ride get bloody
But I just think about my buddy
And go after that money
But uhh..
 
Ohhh, we gotta get over, we gotta get over, gotta get over
It's almost over, and we gon be alright
Straight Patron out the bottle to the head now

Escape
Ya birthday could be ya death date
So I'm livin like it was just yesterday

Shoot him up, shut him down, shut him up
Eat her out, dick her down, cuddle up
But bitches comin' 'round with the funny love
Lick me up, lick me down, done enough
Eat her up, spit her out, bubblegum
Treat her right, treat her out, trouble come
Got some cocaine and a couple blunts
It's ashes to ashes, dust to dust
.44 plastic, the rubber bust
We don't wear masks, 'cause it must be us
I got the Holy Ghost in my Backwood
On my tippytoes and them flat-foot
Bitch pigeon-toed and her cat good
I know her pussy hole like my MacBook
She Tootsie-Roll on the black wood
Get her own page in the black book
And it's startin' to feel like I'm attached to her
If it's that good, I put a stamp to her
I'm a warlord to these fuckin' boys
Double-edged sword and a bubble, boy
I just won a war in a Hummer 'fore I'm 'bout to come to yours
Lookin' for a war, I am nothin' more than somethin' more
Than much more as the punch pour
And I slunch more with my lungs sore
I smoke you and your blunt blowers
Let's get on with it, Megatron with it
Telephone like a telethon
Bitches workin' bitches like a Peloton
Finish yellow bones dizzy, very long visits
And I'm talkin' numbers, Jerry Jones digits
I'm at home sippin', and I'm gone sippin'
Got a Draco with my arm in it
Shoot you in your heart, put some charm in it
Sorry, gotta leave your mama tormented
"Bah, bah, bah" if she commented
Cops pulled up, and they vomited
I am not finished, hope they long-winded
Money long-livin' with a strong finish
Dead presidents, wasn't born with it, I'ma die with it
I'm amor with it, didn't start livin' 'til the war ended
It's wartime, wartime, wartime
Y'all lil' niggas small time
All my niggas ex-cons
And we do not fuck with y'all kind
Bitch, it's wartime, wartime, wartime
Y'all lil' niggas small time
All my niggas done time

It's still wartime, wartime, wartime

Polo jammers, Louis slippers
Call them "private plane clothes"
I'm taking off, going to another land
Call her misses, never going to another man
Shabba Ranks Weezy, muthafucker, I'm a lover man
Yeah talk that shit Tune
I gotta wipe my diamond grill with a tissue
I'm talking too much shit
I eat pussy and you suck dick
They call me "Lil Nut" but my nuts aren't
The same. No homo, that's how I came in the
The game, I married Mary Jane, I seen the
Spidermane, the shit that made Pinky blow
Out the Brain brain. Told Lois Lane
I can't be a Super Mane, my whole
Suit black like bat mane and I keep that iron, mane
Any woman yellow flag me, throw me out
The game, I'm back at the halftime
Like it's just an ankle sprain
Ain't no one could do it better
More hits than Eddie Guerrerra
The flow like ? at the competitors
It's mass hysteria. Historic in
Your area, 51 alien, what planet is he from
Huh? Ain't no fun when the rabbit got the shotgun
Picture Bugz with the shotgun up to Elmer Fudd
All my thugs get dirty like we running
In the mud, we 7:30 livewires
Plug off the chain, utterly untame
Put the gun to your frame, bitch a bloodstain
Hard to come out, like a love-stain
I came from nothing, fucking calling hoes
And flying planes; who the fuck could complain?
So you mad cause I'm styling on you?
Lights off, mask on, creepy siding on you
Get violent on you, you a sissy like Sisqó
Gudda: I'm the East gang schizo
It's no coincidence, man, I bet your bitch know
How I knock her down with the Kosher dill pickle
How I yell a nigga but my heart dark like nut skin
Bitches aiming for the pockets? You get nothing
Let me get back in it, bitch
I just go ahead first, you be on that timid shit
Get head first, then I be on my Jimmy shit
Shitting on bitches with that Chris Brown
"Don't give me shit!" Niggas in the streets say
"Kill them all!" Bitch, you know we got guns
Like the Pentagon. I'm just eating nigga
I'm getting my dinner on
And your bitch licking: getting her lizard on
Talk reckless, I don't give a muthafuck
I make you do what you is, bitch nigga, duck
Come for you and your kids like nigga what
Niggas with elephantitis ain't got bigger nuts
Young Money nigga: big dicks, big trucks
I'mma smash a nigga if he try to diss us
Go to court: the case get dissmussed
Cause if we did time, your main bitch would miss us
It's Mack Maine: ain't shit to discuss
I get up in a bitch throat like hiccups
I Chris Kringle bullets with niggas like Christmas
Then turn to their female dog like "bitch, what?"
My niggas squeeze triggers like they got arthiritis
My dick big: that's why I walk like I got tendonitis
I spit nasty on the mic like I got gingivitis
The doc said I got a case of "real" nigganitis
He ain't got a vaccine or cure strong enough to fight it
See, I'm a warrior. They compare me to Leonidus
I got a set fee: I ain't about discussing prices
Cause I ain't tryna go broke like Hammer or Mike Tyson
Wish you could see my face now
Feel like I'm poltergeisting
See me in streets, be Street Fighting like
Blanka or Bison. Slicing, dicing
Like w butcher knifeing. Wifing
Bitches? Never, that shit is trifling
Young Money the fucking nicest
Put words together like a fucking hypen
Nigga don't make us start fucking rifling
Nigga we got a lot of rappers striking
Standing by the harvest for fruit
Waiting for the fruit to ripen
We run up on niggas and jack the for their stipend
Catch me in Minnesota like I'm a Viking
I'm with every video vixen you liking
I'm the reason your bitch dyking
How I get like this?
I'll pump a nigga breaks, something like Midas
I try to be modest, nigga I'm honest
And this is what I did for my birthday, bitch
I ain't get no pussy thoughTay Keith, fuck these niggas up
I tell you I love you
I tell you I need you
I say I won't leave you
I like when I'm faded, I'm so innovative
Eatin' pussy at my dinner table, I been gettin' it catered
Get the yayo, got me spendin' pesos, Benjamin tornado
Count my blessin's, this is what we pray for, everyone ain't able
Drop her heart, just like a hot potato, I'ma say though
She think she lit, I am fuego, keep that BS in her a-hole
'Cause I say so, and my bando, we just lay low
Rub my back, ask how my day go
I say I been on my Jay-O
She say, "They know", say no mo'
'Cause she go low, bless my wo-wo
I say "Uh-oh," she start slow-mo
Once that coco start her mojo
She gon' go-go, she gon' deep throat 'til it's sore throat
She go deep sleep, I go NoDoz
Said "I love you," watch my nose grow
Once that dope go, she go bozo
Girl, I'm gone
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby

I tell you I love you, baby

I tell you I love you, baby 
I tell you I need you, baby 
I say I won't leave you, baby 
I like when I'm faded 
So outta here, keep that shit over there
Where do we go from here
Come to the end of the road
Can't get the road repaired
I am on Mars with a bitch in her underwear
She take 'em off and then come back to Earth
In a hundred years, you niggas Gummy Bears
Rest in peace Rabbit
I got the Lamborghini doors up like some bunny ears 
Bitch, best not jump in here
Bitch, best not run in here talkin' crazy
Get her walkin' papers
See these married niggas makin' it hard for players
But, see, the hardest players is too hard to play
I give her dick and a couple ultimatums
A cup of bumbu and a cup of coffee later
She do all the drugs, he do all the favors
So we fuck now and we argue later
Dick runnin' like an alternator
I don't separate 'em, I just alternate 'em
I got all the flavors, sit back enjoy the fruit of our labors
You gon' tan that applebottom, it's gon' be orange later
So I fucked the girl, wrote my number down
On the morning paper, set it on the table
Told her, "I'll be back" - Schwarzenegger
Li'l mama, I'm gone

"Who that, the president?" "Yeah, me" No one scare me
And you ain't gotta double dare me, hear me?
Loud and clearly, rats aren't near me
Wiretap niggas get blood in they earpiece
I'm from New Orleans, nowhere near peace
Pure beast, fear-free, dear grief
Catch up, bitch, I'm in gear three
Zoom gone, see ya! Peace... drop one finger
 Fuck 'em and whoever made 'em!
I will hurt whoever love 'em, cause I hate 'em
Lookin' for a lady, high and sedated
Got her to the pad, I don't know how a nigga made it
She gave me relations, so now, we related
The morning comes; the picture, faded
I waited on my turn to burn, can I get a light?
Little dog, bigger bite, Jackson Five, Little Mike
Can I get a mic or a mic and a half
That the Source owe me? Shout out to the editing staff, yeah
I'm all grown, so much better with math
I need a spread in the Forbes takin' a Benjamin bath, yeah

Niggas know my rhetoric; bitches know my preference
Young God, baby: all them other niggas reverends
Sittin' in my big house surrounded by my weaponries

Chopper right next to me, loaded up with pepper seeds
Got an extra clip, but that's only for my especiallies, yeah

The craziest place I've ever seen a Lil Wayne tattoo on someone is... you ready? So, I'm 'bout to explain it, um... inside the lips of their pussy. Um, that's just the craziest place. So like, even when you see the pussy, she can show any man her pussy, he won't see it. She has to literally open her pussy up for you to see the name. Shout out- shout my homegirl, that's my homegirl, one time for her. I love you, girl. What's the craziest place I haven't seen a Lil Wayne tattoo is when people come up to me and say "You know I got your name on me, but, like, I can't show you right now 'cause I'm in work," or, "I can't show you right now 'cause," whatever. You ain't got my fuckin' name on you, shut the fuck upI have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time
You got one night only

And no one gon take it from her, nothing's gon' make her miss it
And when I go she'll miss it
But she'll never forget that )
Next day another city, she's never coming with me
I'm nothing more than memories
Memories she keep forever
She always dream about me, wish she could sleep forever
She get her fit together, she get her shit together
After my concert, she wanna get together
I get her on my bus, we chill and sit together
She has no curfew, I can take the bitch wherever
Come off a bit respectful, I'm on a different level
I got her feelin special, then she remember
She got )
But I can make you love me forever
Baby I can make you love me forever
Now all the hoes hate her, the dudes wanna date her
Her nigga saw her leave, she deal with him later
Right now she with the greateast, I'm even homie's favorite
How could he even blame her, she doin him a favor
She let that nigga love her, she let that nigga save her
But when I come she let a nigga take her
Take her for )
She turnin off her phone, she turnin off her pager
Tell hime that shit on roam, that nigga goin in labor
)
These niggas hate the game, but they can't block the layup
And she go home to him, he sicker than a patient
He waitin at the table, no breakfast at the table
He ask her where she been, she say stop trippin it was )
But I can make you love me forever
I can make you love me forever, yeah

And we got )
I got a wife, she knows, my wife ain't on the road
When she come to my room, she take off all her clothes
Say anything goes, tomorrow same clothes
We probably order movies, we probably lay together
But we can't stay together, that's when I gotta tell her
I have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time
You've got one night only

I pile up the swishers, roll 'em tight like UnderArmour
Coming from this neighborhood, it's just like coming from comas
I got homies from the old school and we been lost our diplomas
Got some hoes from California and they shit smell like begonia's
Got a bone to pick, I'm boneless, that's a bonus
Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, pop up at the spur of the moment
How you want it?
When in Hell, I'm a Roman
Head on fire, I'm a comet, heat up out my abdomen
And you know it, man I'm all about my business
Business handle business for me
I know you know life's a bitch, I turned her to a business woman
Mind your business, I'm like-
What's harder? Life or Mr. Carter?
What's higher? The price or Mr. Carter?
Should I call you Mystery 'cause I'm right here to solve you
If you start this here off right, I spray that on you
I made it, I made it with you
You hit it, I made it on you
You know the streets talk, my nigga, I made 'em argue
Niggas faded away, I light one and get faded for you
I'm reclining Weezy Baby, lazy boy do they enjoy you?
I'm like-
What's harder? Life or Mr. Carter? 
What's shorter? Life or Mr. Carter? 
I asked, "What's harder? Jail or Mr. Carter?"
School or Mr. Carter?
Rules or Mr. Carter?
Man, "What's harder? Drugs or Mr. Carter?"
Judge or Mr. Carter?
Mr. Carter, huh?
What's harder? Love or Mr. Carter
Especially when these hoes ain't right, these hoes ain't loyal
Shit, what's wrong or right? And what's the order?
I know this AK will get shit right and fix the toilet
I'll be a-okay as long as my wife could cook a quarter
The type of shit I won't take for granted, need the marble
See, you can't believe in all of the hype you hear at the barber
If the odds are stacked against us, they're likely to stack 'em on us
Lil Tune, aka no cartoon, no Hanna-Barbera
I ain't steal it, I took it, I ain't crooked, I'm cat and cornered
And if my fruits of labor were ripe, I would have an orchard
But I'm nauseous from my ups and downs and back and forwards
Shit, Mr. Carter, eyes are always on ya
Throw a five in the air for C5 like, "Hi, how are you?"
Shit, what's harder? Drugs or Mr. Carter?
The world is on my shoulder, I shrug to get it off from shit
What's harder? Life or Mr. Carter?
Tune in this bitch, let's spike the Holy Water
Tryna stay grounded, my flights said no departures
Shit, what's harder? Murder or abortion?
Woah, what's harder? Death or Mr. Carter?
Is it easier to play deaf or to listen harder?
I'm like, "Girl, what's harder than life for Mr. Carter?"
Shit get hard, but I'ma termite to turmoil
Was it easier to change diapers or back to normal?
Times are changing like Father Time just lost it's father
What's harder? To ask for sorrow or to borrow
Or to propose and get "I don't know"?
I don't know
What's harder than being Mrs. Carter?
What's harder than being Mrs. Carter?
What's harder than being Mrs. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?
Uh, what's harder than being Mr. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mmThis is what they call me
Eagle, Eagle Carter man
In a '96 Regal contraband
On my way to the east to the laundromat
Got to wash that money and get on my ass
Gotta flip them bricks it be gone so fast

Dollar holler at your boy on the ave
In that Jeep pidico is what I'm known to have

But I'm a designated hitter I adjust so fast

Out of all the Hot Boyz she say I'm the coolest

This game is a bitch and I'm trying to seduce it

But the laser on the 45 is eyeing you stupid
One shot to remind you who is
That fly little nigga that's behind the trigger, Wizzle
I'm off chronic combined with liquor
But niggas'll never see me like Momma Tigger
A 80's-baby a fighting nigga
I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga
I'm something you call pepper like a Viking slick
See me over the viking stove I'm whitening bricks
Or in the middle of the shoot out untightening clips
Pop another one shoot back while lighting a spliff

Representing with my section on my belly and shit

So roll the carpet out cause you fucking with a nigga from the royal South
See you either in or you out and if you out stay in cause them warriors out
Those vultures, them cops, and the lawyers out

No nigga I never call your house I'm probably somewhere taking Toya out
Not answering my phone, man, ignoring ya spouse
She leaving messages about me enjoying her mouth
Hey I'm ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name naw better yet point him out
Hey, me and the streets got a joint account
I'm from the streets that you need to be warned about
New Orleans whoa they put the gat in your mouth
And we tote a lot of iron to flatten you out
Few roaches but never had no rats in this house
Never tell on one another leave that in the house
Always been a small hustler moving my packaging out
I ever run into some trouble send them savages out
These niggas talking sweet I get them cavities out

Hey bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now I am the princeI gets it in all day

Millz twisting up the sticky not that barnyard hay

Yep, 3 whips back to back
Followed by a Cadillac
Trucks, sluts with us, fake tits and their asses fat
Gudda ain't your average cat, I’m something like a savage that
Came up in the jungle and adjusted to this habitat

Gettin money is the only time life make sense
People like me, but people like spiders
And spiders eat flies and you know what flies eat
And kids are the only ones that really blush
I’m real as fuck
I pull that thing and get 'em up
That bullet travel hit a gut
Then hit your fitted up
Hit your whole city up
Hit you while you laying down
Shots leave you sittin up
Run in the bathroom on your girl and get a titty fuck
Right after I bust a nut I bust the gun get rid of her
Y'a bunch of pussy’s having a pity party
My guns look like they in kindergarten
I’m the dirtiest seed in any garden
Got more stripes on my sleeve than any sergeant
The paralyzed feel me, the blind see me
And the deaf can hear me
And the smart fear me
Wh-which side you on?
Hi-highway to heaven, I would drive you home
Uhh
Eagle street where them twenty’s go for 25
Bitch I’m a boss I got ya ho in my assembly line

I saved us from hip hop genocide
Medication in my cup, it's cause my flow's sick
Got a syringe in my drawers, call it dope dick
And my girls say you niggas can’t fuck with me
Check my footsteps look like there was couple me’s
We ain't promised tomorrow, but I feel immortal
Bullets beat yo ass up like Miguel Cotto
I’m the real Zorro, Rest in peace Toro
And when I die, bury me in all Polo
Kanyeezy’s on my feet with two pony tails
Bitch I’m hotter than going to hell
Oh well and the money is my only mail
And I’m a God sippin’ syrup out the Holy Grail

Twitter Wayne at the top of every song list
I’m spittin like a long kiss
Live from the throne bitchIt's so simple that it's complicated, uh
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em, yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin'
'Cause only in still water we can see our faces
Real shit, I told my nigga
"Boy, you better watch them hoes when you sleepin'
Nigga, them dog ass hoes be creepin'"
I got a few Ms put up for safe keeping
Long hair, don't care like I was raised in a tipi
Nigga, gun hurt, Nina said she 'bout to go streaking
Niggas 'bout to go to missin', niggas 'bout to go to deacons
Niggas 'bout to get high as airmen from Tuskegee
Niggas blind to the fact 'cause they don't wan' see me
Niggas don't wan' talk, niggas don't wan' reason
Niggas don't want peace, niggas don't know the meaning
Nigga said "You're a bitch, nigga", bitch European
Nigga we Herculean, nigga, skate service skiing
Nigga really overseeing, y'all niggas sight seeing
Tomorrow is what a nigga ain't guaranteeing
New Orleans had a sheriff by the name of Harry Lee
When he died, niggas shouted out, "Tha-thank you, Jesus"
Cruising down the street and I ain't Caribbean
Ain't terrified and I ain't never been
Sippin' H-Town, lookin' like Jeremy Lin
I'm movin' slower than a fuckin' Maryland terrapin
I ain't got time, patience very thin
I will fuck a nigga bride on the day she marry him
I'm a bad samaritan, I'm a black American
Got white like a fuckin' Aryan, and
I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga
Grave yard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
Now beam me up, Scotty
You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub
With "Stop snitchin" written on a note by her body
I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny
I wore something simple, she like that about me
My dope from the nineties, my dope ain't consignment
My coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client
These hoes be relying, these niggas be lying
These niggas who snitching we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifying, you know that's as quiet
So scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizing
You caught up too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie, "I know where to find him"
He said, "You late, we already got him
And by the way, it was an honor"
That made my day, made me so proud
I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer
And a chihuahua
What's the occasion? Don't worry about it
I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
Call me the greatest or call me retired
It's up in the air, like carbon monoxide
Bitch, we in the building, we started from outside
My dick is my third eye and she call it cock eyed
My bath tub lift up, my walls do a 360
She get so wet, it gave me sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy F-U, with a sick dick
Hop on my skateboard, do a quick trick
Playin' my role, even with a thick script
Waitin' on a revolution, hope I get a big tip
Smoking on Cee-Lo Green, lighting up a big gift
Every bud get nipped, life is so vibrant and the suns just trip
Anything can happen, put the "Whats" with the "Ifs"
But what's with the ifs?
Just pass that weed like flying colors
Light green teal turquoise, purple
When I'm in a room, if these walls could talk
I'm sure they'd prefer to be non-verbal
Poppa was a rolling stone, worthless
Momma said I wasn't on purpose
That's why I got a ice box where my heart used to be in this cold world
I'm a monster, a cold blooded monster
I'm colder than fuckin' Moscow, kilos, ounces, Grammies, Oscars
Knock you off your fuckin' high horse
Like a cold blooded jouster, fighting for my life
Praying to the ring-side announcer
It's so simple that it's complicated, yeah
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em, yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin'
'Cause only in still water we can see our faces
Real shit, tell 'em
I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga
Grave yard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper with me
Grave yard, a penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
Now beam me up, ScottyWhat does dedication mean to you?
Umm, nowadays, dedication mean to me...umm, the same thing it's meant all the rest of-whatever, same thing it's always meant man. Just get on the mixtape, have fun, enjoy myself. Say things that I wouldn't say on my album or, you know what I mean, say things that I wouldn't on a album. On anyone's album for that case or whatever
Anyway, yeah, dedication still means the same thing: just get on this shit and go crazy and just talk what I want to talk, say what I want to say. And all the people that's featured on the mixtape, shoutout to them anyway. I tell them the same thing, man do what you want, say what you want, let's just have fun, enjoy ourselves, and show people that we could rap. We can make words rhyme. Yeah and it's still dedicated to you fuck-niggas

Fuck the head of the state, fuck the gates surroundin' the prisoners
These muthafuckas the prey; I'm the Predator, see me dreadlock
Tough as Bamm-Bamm from Bedrock; I'm tied to the game like wedlock
Say "hello, red dot", say "goodbye, life" and say "hello, Satan"

Around the clock, yes it’s my time, my throne
Better know the time of day in any fuckin' time zone
I’m feelin' like I’m on top of the rhinestone
Pullin' the ladder from heaven, about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
In this world of numbers, I keep my nine on
And I don’t go to church because the lyin' long
And the preacher, he be gettin' his shine on

Can't stop now cause that ain't me
Tryna stay afloat on my inner tube
When they turned my city into a swimmin' pool
Before that, it was a livin' cesspool
We gotta get on our shit, like gnats do
Polices be on my tip, like hats do
But I stay strong like blacks do
Never saved by the bell in a black school
And I stay in trouble like Zack do
And in this game, nobody’s on my plateau
Therefore my name remains, like a tattoo

Cause that ain't me
Alright; alright, alright, alright

The title's up for grabs, I’m into confiscation
Punch, shot, and stab; now you're the doctor's patient
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation
I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hatin'
And these niggas ain't shit, like they're constipated
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light, that's when I be headed
So far ahead of them I feel outdated
But I feel electric like I’m Rayden
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
And now I’m coming out the faders, no homo
Yeah, don’t you know I’ll be

I don't make mistakes, I just make my case
Drops mic when I'm done, what more can I say?
I bite to my tongue, I don't like the taste
I'm on in the morning, I own my opponents
I'm always in the zone, need to zone out to zone in
And we could get it popping, pick the topic if you want it
Skip and Shannon, skip that hopping
Took these fours and made a posse, alright
You are kidding me, whoa
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down
No feelings, relentless
Fearless, relentless
Fearless, relentless
Fearless, relentless
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down
No feelings, relentless
Fox Sports OneLike I dropped straight from heaven
Five strong words: rest in peace Lil Kevin
And this ain't how I was born
But this is how I live
So that's how I'll die, and do not close my eyes
So when you see me in the casket I'm a look right back at ya
Cause I don't trust none of y'all
Fuck every one of y'all
Now which one of y'all wanna brawl?
And overall I got that pistol under all of my garments
Torment, torture
Tragedy, catastrophe
No battery, just murder in the coldest temperature
And that means first degree
Even deaf motherfuckers done heard of me
I ain't gonna let you motherfuckers worry me
And tell that beef I'm Burger King
I represent that saint's sign
I'm so high I can paint signs
And if she ain't fine, she ain't mine
Thank god that I'm alive
But if he end it all today, I have done more that I can say
Let's pray 
Ten fingers 
Together for forever 
Let's pray 
Together 
Forever, forever
The Lord is my shepherd
You haters can't harm me
I walk with his blessings
The angels be my army
Of course there's a weapon on my waist within arm's reach
That's my baby keep it strapped in like a car seat 
Though I walk through the valley in the shadows of death
Forgive me Lord I had to carry my tech
I touch cash and get cheese
Play with that cash I bust mags, indeed
Forgive those who trespassed against me
For they know not what they do until they history
Gone, memories
Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
Like what happens when I get up with my enemies
Paybacks, penalties
Bang back, send em' these
Funerals, these people got to waste more Hennessey 
They got to pour it on the floor for ya
Maybe next time they'll pray a little more for ya
I pray to God not Lucifer
Devil I'm rebuking ya
Lord have mercy on my soul when I'm suited up
Daddy was a hustla, mommy was a Christian
Momma said prayers, daddy steady cookin' chicken
If I'm living life wrong, I don't wanna be right
Send me blessings to the cloud, hope I make it through the night
Dear Lord as you lay me down to sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
Then I pray to the Lord my soul to take
There shall be no other god before thee
Lord please forgive me of my sins if I O.D, slowly
I know I should not kill but I will
If a nigga try to shoot me and lay me still
I'm so sorry for the wrong thing's that I've done
This the end of my prayer we all say amen
Dear God
As I begin this day, my thoughts turn to you
And I ask for your help and guidance in everything I say and do
Give me the patience that I need to keep my peace of mind
And with life's cares, I hope dear God, some happiness to find
Let me live but for today, not worrying what's ahead, for I have trust that you
Will see I get my daily bread
Give me the courage to face life's trials and not from troubles run
And let me keep this thought in mind "Thy will, not mine, be done."
And if some wish I do not get though I have prayed to thee
Please help me to believe and understand you know what's best for me
I've failed you many time, I know
But tonight when I rest
I hope that I can say, "Dear God, I've tried my best....rapper alive."They give her bread, I give her head
I'm light years ahead, gone
They give her bread, I give her head
I'm light years ahead, gone
I know she gon' hold the gun for me
Hold it down in court, and hold her tongue for me
She swallow all my kids, then pop a gun for me
Makes some runs for me, all the way cross country
She love me, she even rep the blood for me
I said the plug trippin'
She gon' pull the plug for me, I love it
And all she know is Young Money
Her ex is always trippin', nigga is too clumsy
Make up on the pillow, make me wanna kill her
But she naked in the villa, taking E I call it Sheila
I took half of a half, she took 3 like Reggie Miller
I just feel her like chinchilla, had to kill her, Bryson Tiller
I know they gon' play this over, ankles on my shoulder
My face all in her chocha, for my bae go South Dakota
But my bae go even lower on that roller coaster
She just want a Tesla roadster, I'ma get her somethin' slower
Bet a Bentley Truck to show her, tinted up to hide her ass
Who in that Wraith behind her ass, you ain't even got to ask
She ain't even gotta dance, thinkin' boutta a wider ass
And she already gotta an ass, leave it in the doctor hands
Other niggas, not a chance, she already gotta dare
When I be in and out your ass, baby you sound like jazz
You ask me can your partner crash, you ain't even gotta ask
I'm breaking out the powder bags, turn into Iron Man
What happens in this house stays in this house
Don't worry 'bout that
If what happens in this house gets out
Go check your girl 'bout that

I'm working with the perfect bitch, her body like 187

That's flowers in bed, that's magic
She lie in the bed, then cry in the bed, I lie on her leg, damn
See they give her bread, I give her head, I'm light years ahead, pyoom
I know she gon' hold a gun for me
Always down in court and hold her tongue for me

My favorite person to debate sports with is, um, Skip Bayless off top. Like Skip Bayless, that's just the homie, you know what I mean. Like when I say the homie, I mean, like when you goin' to Skip Bayless, when I go to the Skip Bayless show, there's always more conversation off camera, and its always like he can't wait for them to say 3,2,1 and we off. For him to engage in a, um, more whatever, realer conversation, I don't know if real is the right word, a more real conversation, just things like that, so you know
My favorite person to debate sports with Skip Bayless. I do have a second favorite as well, if it's not even a second favorite, but another favorite person I love to debate sports with: Max Kellerman. That's my dude. Love to debate sports with Max Kellerman, that's my slime. And every time I go on his show, he always got a verse for me. You know what I mean, that's the homie
I'ma be alright*lighter flick*
Aye
I'm a lover, not a fighter, I can't find my lighter
My house is five stories, I don't tell 'em, I don't write 'em
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright, I'mma need a sun visor
187 make your bitch run my errands
At the bar with the Dracula, ordering Bloody Marys
Got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see Hell out my window, Lord, this view is amazing
If I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands, it got all under my nails
People under the stairs, better not fuck with my feet
I be so fucking faded, who washed the colors with bleach?
Niggas biting my style, hope it gets stuck in their teeth
I been had the green light, now please don't jump in the street
C'est la vie, oui oui oui, watch me french kiss the sky
Then ask, "What is that smell?" That's the shit on my mind
I don't like you, or niggas like you
And Nino Brown's still my motherfucking idol
Keep a brown rifle for niggas like you
Kill you in a drive-thru, then go viral
Ooh, I don't like you and niggas like you
And Nino Brown's still my idol
The Glock 17 is still a minor I'll kill you over something minor
I get at you, night Twighlight whine like a wine-o, high like a high-note
Go at your head like a rhino, leave your shit bloody red like albino
I'm a nigga with a title, care less bout' a nigga title
I'm entitled and get homicidal
Wild as El Chapo, wild as Al Qaeda
Stuntin' on my rivals upon arrival
Numbers aren't liars, I am number one
I am on one
I am on ten stuntin' on twelve
I keep it a hunnid
Oh Lord!

I'm cool like that, but the climate is climbing
I got issues bigger than you, I got bitches taller than me
All that ratchet and bougie, I guess I like R&B
I'm unapologetic, I'm sorry for not being sorry
These niggas so old news, I’m talking prehistoric
I need benadryl for my trigger finger
Bad bitches for my homeboys
The grass is greener on the other side
I'm focused on my own yard
Focused on getting more dough
Twisting up like torsos
Rich as fuck, but moreso a poor soul
Oh well, if snow fell like hoes fell, then I'd be a snowman
My bitch is a soldier, fuck me GI Joe-Ann

Depressions, recessions, the past and the present
Slavery to segregation, I still rob with my brethren
See these shackles up up off me, I'm street but I'm Godly
Know these white folks fear me but nothin' can stop me
I was destined to be this so nothin' amaze me

Wheeling in my fortunes
Willing to kill you just for my fortunes
I can recall we were chillin' on porches
Living with roaches, dealin' with hoe shit
Ceilings to low shit, now we in motion, everything kosher

Spent a bundle on the cross because I'm spiritual
And I can never pass a physical, I stay high
High as the voice of Akon
And make mine a straight with no chase
Hold the ice, I got enough on anyway
And when they see the boy, they hyperventilate
I got 'em running after me like I'm about to win a race

You can get the top of your can popped like 7-Up
Knock knock let us up, Young Money applaud me
And we’ll take the game out your hands like a joy stick
I’ma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn’t given
Everything that I’ve given, I swear I’ll never give in
Just look at what I’ve been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-do it cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowing kisses to the soldiers, I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camouflage me
Cause Young Money is the Navy better yet the Army
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute
Commander-in-Chief

Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now that's G
Don’t ask me about shit but money
Fuckin’ right my money long I got that 10-foot money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sounds like 10 foots running

I’m a purple heart proven war vet, rookie
You can’t even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don’t step to me
Now don’t step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the court building

I know at all times gods feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me

Young Mula baby
I’m goneDear Till Family:
As a recording artist, I have always been interested in word play. My lyrics often reference people, places and events in my music, as well as the music that I create for or alongside other artists
It has come to my attention that lyrics from my contribution to a fellow artist’s song has deeply offended your family. As a father myself, I cannot imagine the pain that your family has had to endure. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge your hurt, as well as the letter you sent to me via your attorneys
Moving forward, I will not use or reference Emmett Till or the Till family in my music, especially in an inappropriate manner. I fully support Epic Record’s decision to take down the unauthorized version of the song and to not include the reference in the version that went to retail. I will not be performing the lyrics that contain that reference live and have removed them from my catalogue
I have tremendous respect for those who paved the way for the liberty and opportunities that African-Americans currently enjoy. As a business owner who employs several African-American employees and gives philanthropically to organizations that help youth to pursue their dreams my ultimate intention is to uplift rather than degrade our community
Best
Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr
Lil WayneBitch I'm Mack Maine

Future
I know they can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
Bitch I'm Mack Maine
I got the heart of a king, blood of a slave
Feel like I been there before, my second time to the grave
But it's one life to live, that's why I'm gettin' paid
Off a flow that's priceless, I just got it appraised
Spit like I need a raise, blaze as I gaze
At the stars and ask the Lord, why the culprit's at the pulpit
It make me sick to my stomach, that's why I rap
Like a pregnant woman, I don't spit I vomit
So pay homage, me and Wayne two G's
Like twenty hundreds and we keep the semis blunted
And we live like brothers from another
So fuck with him and Mack gonna react like you did me somethin'
That's a hint to you Davids, throwin' shots at Goliath
This the New Testament, where the victor is the giant
So you should get your weight and lose the hate
Remember males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female's traitMichael Phelps this for you baby
I’m goin’ for the gold
My heart is in control, my mind is on succeed
And I am in the lead
Don’t buy into the schemes
The science or stratege
Just giant N-U-T’s brings triumph and relief
I’m reliant on redeem, inspired by the green
Never tieing off of fatigue, never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I’m lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things I’m a die as a king
If I don’t do it now I’m a try it again
And when I do accomplish it
I’m a try it again, I’m a riot insane
I’m a lion my mane hangs down to my strings
And they’re tied to the game, I stay dry when it rain
I’m tried of the fame
Got everything to gain and I’m proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane besides we’re the same
Whose guiding the train, whose flyin’ the plane
Whose drivin’ the lane
Who dies when it bang, who fires when it bang
Who lies in the aim
Two lives in the drain, who cries when they sang
You hide but you can’t, you hide but you ain’t
I advise you to thank, you’ll find what you can’t
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank, the fries and the drank
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank, combined with my strength
My time and my length, I’m a iron out the kinks, yes I’m on the brink
And in the eye of a wink, I’m a retire in the bank yeeaahhh
And I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
No I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeaaahhhh I, I’m gon’ get it, I, I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it yeeaahhh
Cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Sshh, victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy’s misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively
You can’t harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually
You’ll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of this is what you did to me
Nothin’s what you did for me, nothin’s what you give to me
I take whatever I’m visualing
Now break all of the limiting, now shake all of the gimicking
The fakery, the trickery, nurse how sick is he, worse I’m sickening
I’ll be at the finish line first
How quick is he, I’ma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain’t with the bickering, I’m full of dignity, I’m full of energy
Pull out the inner me or bull after dinner meat
I stood in the winter heat, it could be the end of me, but good be defending me yeeeaaahhh
And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
And I’m no quitter cause I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeaahhh I’m allergic to cheatin’
I hate failure and I’m in love with achievement
Above and beneath it
A hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize
And I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin’ begun with the preachin’
Now pray until I am one with the deacon
Now play until I have won whatever we win
I play until I have won and then I re-win, yeeeaaahhhh
And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter
I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it, yeah I’m gon’ get it yeah
And I’m no quitter, I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter
I’m a go, I’m a go, I’m a go getter
Yeeeaaaahhh and I’m no quitter

Ice on the neck of me, ice on the wrist of me
Ice in both hands bitch I'm lit like a Christmas tree

Shit I must have been 7 goin' on 8
And comin' from da kitchen was an echo from all the bass
And I ain't talkin bout speakers
I saw my daddy in there I would stare, but I wouldn't touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Shit, I just knew too much
So I stop bein' lazy, and I became creative
And I learned how to create it
And all that pot's for me
So come see, or come eat
And I hope that she is having da ride of her life
No red lights in sight
Just a bare room with green lights
Come on now
Who did you, where did you, why did you what did you think she was
That's your ho
But does her water help your garden grow... no
Yeah I know that was crazy
But I think you are more crazier than her
Cuz she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
With no seeds
So she can't eat
My heroes had the broads and the cars with big ol' rims
And I could remember slangin', thinkin'
I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
I lived life numb
It made so much sense for me to run
When da 5-0 come
Cause I ain't dumb

I was hustlin' as a baby
You can ask Eagle Street, about me

Cause it made no sense where I was from
To walk around wit none

You should be proud of me

But it's Weezy Baby for your slut
I told her Weezy Baby, I told her more than once
But she just say, "Baby", she just calls me "Baby"
She just screams out "Baby!" when she's on top of me
And the sheets be stickin' like pages
And the bed is so stanky
If she say that is my baby, shit it is possibly not for me

Eat the track up and leave the mic barbecued
Why in 30 lives would you ever war with I

But now I'm making money even when I sleep
Eyes wide awake, but I really need a dream

This a lot worse, so hear the shot burst:
Every hustle, we hustle, hustle - hey!
Straight from the bottom, now I'm high as a mountain
From the city where you need way more protection than a condom
Had a dream but I'm conscious, see the veins in my sockets
In the sky, wishing I could turn this plane into a rocket
And just leave here, more money but the problems still live here
I feel the pressure from my lil peers
Cause I'm about to blow, Swisher Sweet breathe in
One hit, lose your breath, all I do is  win
Big fish swimming in the deep end
No present, fuck I'm into pretense
I remember rainfall in the street
Now I'm in the club: watch me make this bitch precipitate
I promised to myself I would be the best
You could say I'm crazy or a mess
Just hand me a wrench

Shout out to the pilots that died takin' off
The crime rate evolve, but I take the charge

Vibrating floors for my groundbreaking bars
The crowd gave applause then the clouds gave us stars
When all faith is lost, you just gotta say the thoughts
Can't let us down, pause, fast forward, play, record
It's a lake to cross, hope you make it straight across
To make it safe across, we leave when we should take a cross
And when the day gets dark, that's when the fire start
They cryin' "Amen amen," the third times the charm

Cause he like to eat snacks
And I like to eat rappers like he like to eat snacks
I call em emcee snacks
You emcees wack
How 'bout your funeral? Let me emcee that!
Three emcee facts:
My name's Dwayne Michael Carter, DMC's back!
Nigga walk this way
And I'm gonna paint your ass like an art display
I'm really rich, I just talk this way
And maybe if you get rich you'll talk this way!
See, right now I'm talking foreign, you dig? I'm talking foreign
Leave a hole in the boy big enough to park a car in
You're on, but you ain't on it, I'm more on like Warren
Move, boom! Now my bitch talking for me
Damn, and she's so slutty
Cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Man, she'll do him and everyone of his buddiesShe was the sweetest ever
Whatever happened to forever
She never say never, she rather say whatever
I’d rather stay together and she’d rather chase the devil
Now I’m left to race the rebel
Bartender make it several
Turn up the bass and treble
How bout I make it metal
I’m such a fatal fellow
And shes the reason why
Because without the muthafucker I’d die
I’d die, I’d die
So bury me today or tomorrow
Cause I’ve buried myself away
In the sorrow in May
I die before I wake
I pray I’m resurrected for her nightmares sake
But you love me
At least thats what she said
That whole weekend in my bed
But there was a speaker in my head
Saying “seek and you’ll be led”
But instead, instead I loved you
I was weak and mislead
I was deeper than dead
I was sinking in dread now I’m thinking in shreds
So I inked this in red
But she loves me
She loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love
I used to tell myself I wouldn’t do this to myself
Until I proved it to myself
And now I’m losing myself
I used to have my shit together but now
You see now, I with whatever
And now, you see, now, you with whoever, forever and ever
And everybody know I ain't acting like I’m supposed
I’m attacking my own soul
I’m back in a lone mode
I’m back on that long road
And that road goes forever and ever
I don’t wanna love no more, spare me
You can have my heart its only dead beat
I’m sick of the love songs and the bullshit
When reality bites like a wolf bitch
She’s on top, she wanna kiss
She won't stop, she don’t wanna quit
Then I woke up and I wish I could sleep forever and ever
She loves me, she loves me not
I hate love
Yeah I hate love
Oh my God
I hate love
And I don’t want love, I don’t want love
I don’t wanna love no more
So if you see her you can have her
She’ll be outside my door
So tell a preacher, tell a doctor
I curse the very day you were born
Tell my lawyer to tell a judge that I’m guiltySpit yo game, talk yo shit, grab yo gat, call yo click
Spit yo game, talk yo shit, grab yo gat, call yo click
Squeeze yo clip, hit the right one, pass the weed, I got to light one

The microphone wet 'cause my words like seduction
And when we on the jet, you don't come up in the discussion

Even if you pay 'em, boy, they probably won't fuck you
Only if I say that she can touch you, like Busta

Me and my clique be in red, like Russia

Two girls jump me like double-dutches
My nigga T-Streets know a girl named Duchess
And every time he see her in the street, she be cussing
I told him he should wave the black flag 'cause she bugging
He said "The pussy good," he said, "Ya dig?" So I dug him
I'm looking for a real bad bitch with a husband
I'll give her much dick and a whole lot of nothing
I'm spitting like I stumbled on a gold pot of something
And when I was six, I saw my role model hustling
So I gotta hustle
These rappers talking 'bout a whole lot of nothing
You dropped me on Saturday, I sold out on Sunday
Fuck is the arguing 'bout? Nigga, Tha Carter out
This is what I call a Drought... 3
And we don't walk it out, we drop-top-Porsche it out
They better walk 'em out, before we chalk 'em out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out
We chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk 'em out
They don't want it, uh-uh; no, they don't want it, uh-uh

Kickin rocks on the block, tellin all the OGs
"I be coming for your spot when you're not looking"
Hot cooking, momma got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when them good grades came through
Then the cooked Ks came through
Some soft, some stepped-on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights
Thought I heard niggas coming, thought I saw the cop lights but
I was dreaming, then I woke
The junkies was still fiending, and I had coke, so
I had hope; you may say that it's wrong
But I ain't talking to your child, I'm talking to this song
I'm just doing a buck down memory lane
If I crash, just pick up my brain
And yes, my niggas the same, but they quicker to bang
And if they do, then I'm the nigga you blame
So I shoot first anyway, and I would do the honors any day
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the state like I whip through the yay
Show your ass how to take four and get eight
And it don't take four niggas to get straight
The only hot boy eating off this plate, Young...
Weezy, baby, that's what ya bitch say
Give her ass a location and a template
Show her how to work the interstate
Stop working with that thinner weight, get your brakes fixed
Stop playing, 'cause all we know is gunplay
Trip while you're full and my clip gon be emp-tay
When the stomachs get empty, anything's tempting
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kids' sake
Hurricane wipe the south like a earthquake
We tryna save face, but we ain't got a place
To stay, so they made us evacuate
We on our way, pussies; relocate
Y'all know us when you see us, put your jewels up
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up
It's that serious, homie, pick the news up
It wasn't good, nigga, think about the hood, nigga
The people who ain't never had shit, ain't gon never have shit
Bullshit, 'cause they still gon try to manage
Niggas doin anything, like, God gon' understand them
But please understand us, niggas with money lost mansions
Niggas with nothing lost families
Lives lost in traffic
Water up to the attic, there goes the stashes
But a nigga got passion
Even though the bounce-back seeming like Magic
Shit, but call me Siegfried
Watch how I turn one key to a hundred Gs
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze
Summer, please know I live for you
Throw on the wife-beater, let back the lid for you
A few years I'll prolly hear from you, but now I'm here for you
I know niggas that shed a tear for ya
Behind bars, tryna get to ya, they'll prol'ly never see you
It's that real talk if you ever heard it, homie
Shit hurt so much, might have to hurt you, homie
No commercial, no fronting, no curve on it
No cut, tell life, "So what?"
The drought's here, not only white slowed up
The weed slowed up, we can't even roll up
Fuck, put a dent in the money, too
But that's the last thing, 'cause hustle is what we do
But hustle with what? How we getting on?
Where he sitting at? What he sitting on?
Stand up if you know it's true
The end of the world coming and my city the proof, damn
Shit... And this is after disaster, this ain't rap, this a recap
Stepping off the G4, still strapped
Bust your head in the air, that's a sky-cap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off 'cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon' eat
Then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reaching
And I'm a get death through these bars, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
When everything paused, I proceeded
I'm a leader, me, the son of Jacida
Fuck the world, not the people, damn!Hey
I remember da way
We would both say
We be together
Forever and a day
Well I guess dat day

But timing is an error
And I
Tell a lie
To you like ever
If I was even ever
Given another chance to
"do it again"
Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But I'mma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud

And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud
Then ill be there to catch you

That's some real shit, bitch don't step in it 
That's an ass, no questions asked

Some of these hoes want a wedding band
Some hoes cool with leather bag

Attention to the damn dollar, that's ADD 
I never take away, only A-D-D
And I'm making power moves like- Umm
Back, forward, right punch, kick, A-B-B 
A couple of my homies weren't too good at school

I got a lot of drugs that I could just share

And you can find me grinding on the days we playin'
And that's because I know the sun'll raise again
And when it do I'mma praise the mane
They say you crazy Wayne, but I just bake em mane
And that's Ms. Baker saying, that I'm the...
Hehe yeah
So, now I got..

Hahahaha... Lil tunechi bitch!
Young Moolah baby...Mic check, one, two, on the way to third
Flow sick, put a straitjacket on my words
So sick, they think that something's in the herb
They think I'm gone, but I'm fine, like a woman’s curves
My personality is far from your reality
I'm closer to your girl, now come on, ho, don't embarrass me
There is no comparison, this right here be kerosene
Carousel, parasail, I'm higher than everything
What I spit? You can't drink it, like you're 17
I can show a million pair of eyes what they’ve never seen
And I can do this in whatever the weather brings
Picasso couldn’t paint a better scene
Colossal, now give me the mic and I rock like a fuckin fossil
I'm mad at the track and I beat it like Hector Camacho
What's poppin? What it do? What's happenin'? What's crackin'?
Que pasa? The hospital, mi casa su casa
Bad, I'm rad
And these niggas just squares like plaid
And if they’re cool, then I'm cold
I gets money all day like the toll, bitch
I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw
I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'
I'm 'bout to murder this shit
I'm 'bout to murder this shit
I'm a BET soldier, an MTV gangsta
I will be on VH1 when I'm done being famous
Explain shit, I have made my way
And you are just a stain, bitch, you will fade away
And I only leave my house to paper-chase
Yep, off to the jungle, where I feel safe
Like a home run in the bottom of the 9th inning
And I'm fresh like I'm by Mennen
I'm on the clock like 5 minutes
Tryin' to get passed the line of scrimmage
Yeah, and before I leave her thighs bendin'
She give me face first, like she done dived in it, haha
And if she tall, I can climb in it
I usually don't have a time limit
And eatin pussy ain't a crime, is it? If so
I should start working on my jail visits, you know
I'm in the game, they just sell tickets
Man, I got old bread, like stale biscuits
You feeling froggy, all you gotta do is yell 'Ribbit'
Turn ya ass to a statue, like an exhibit

Let me at 'em, leave my cage open
With no pyro, I leave the stage smokin'
Yes, it's Weezy F, bitch
The best thing since breath, bitch! Suffocate!

Wake up to polices, go to sleep to the gun sounds
And you're not a gorilla, you're a dead monkey
'Cause I got a banana clip in these Red Monkeys
What you said? Don't be afraid to say it twice
And they say life is cheap until you pay the price
It's just like shaking dice, better hope you roll a winner
And if you are a rat, you're just a cobra's dinner
Y'all ain't fuckin with me, you niggas under a G
Like the light part of my feet
And so what them niggas left me?
When it get cold, I turns into Wayne Gretzky

So you can suck my dick with a elephant's tongue
Bitch, it's Weezy Baby
Motherfucker, I spit rabies

And that I will
Yess, Gotta get 'em
Fee! Straight up gangsta, Hollygrove gangsta
Lay a nigga down in pink stuff
Them soft ass dudes just think tough
We shoot and put them shanks up
We tryin' live to summer and put them minks up
I'm sinked up in the coupe, the eyes chinked up
Pull up on a bitch at the light, that night linked up
Whole lotta shit in the life of a young boss
Bet that V.V.S. ice will bite your face off
Yeah, I ignite and take off, now catch up
I'm the best doing it, c'mon niggas 'fess up
Nigga feel different he could chess up and guess what
I bring it to his chest, to his right lung and left lung
Nigga get a check up, nigga put ya cheque up
I swear I'm on fire, need water like a hick-up
So I guess I might as well can say that
I'm the best today and 
Yeah, candy paint! T, I'm ridin' in the peppermint
Even my leather got leather trim
I'm on another element
I keep somethin' in the trunk like a elephant
Bet you remember it, like a elephant
I got this rap bottled up like medicine
Who's better than? Fuck him!
I probably fucked her, ah, what's new?
And if you hatin' on us, yeah, fuck you
And if them bitches wanna fuck us, we wanna fuck too
What a coincidence
And we cause accidents, not incidents
I am big shit, they're eensy-wens
They're not even a letter in my sentences
Sittin' in my coupe on 20-inch
So it's like I'm fencing bitch, I will stunt 
So stop being defensive bitch
I'm relentless bitch, I'm in this shit 
Now end this shitHow can something so right, go so wrong
I used to love her, fuck it, I still do
Cause love never die, but it can kill you
I pray to Heaven's sky, that it never kill me
It can get you real weak, but fuck it I'm a little G
My baby girl thought I was fucking every little freak
But darling, I was raised by a woman, that ain't the real me
Still, she managed to to spill out a little me
Watched the doctors wipe the blood, from her little feet
And goddamn she resembles me
She's my forgiveness for every sin and penalty living in me
She should be living with me
But what am I to do when her mother disagree?
I do me, but...
I even took your hand, and walked down the aisle
It takes a strong man, to do that young and wild
Look at your wedding band, that's 17 thou
But still she took the stand, now I pay for my child
And there comes divorce, mama I had to file
And as sad as it sounds, mama, I'm happy now
And my other girl got a new baby daddy now
And retaliation hurts, she getting married now
And when I lay down to sleep, I feel like I have died, I can be carried out
And buried now
But hear me now, I am here and now
So appealing 'til I disappear, but still, it got me feelin' like...
I'm in my early 20s, now all the ladies dig me
They like that baby face, they like the Baby in me
That's why it's Weezy Baby, and please say the baby
You know that nigga baby, yeah, he done paid me crazy
I won a few Source awards, I haven't won an a Oscar
So I don't know how to act, like my sweet ain't sour
So I run to my mama
She let me smoke and fret about my drama, then give me power
I'm a go and use all my knowledge and get acknowledged
If the pro tools stop recording, I'm still ballin'
I know you probably don't care about where my heart is
But just to let you know, it's where yours is
But...Grrr
I did not come here to see who was litty
That stamp on the kilos say "key to the city"
Put some on my thumb and then I make her lick it
She can't feel her tongue, well, bitch, I beg to differ
I smoke gasoline and I sip down some lean
My whole tangerine on this dick, trampoline
I chop you up, they call them amputees
I spit these facts, they call me fax machine
I drop a four in this, I'm feelin' glorious
Gun on Big Pun, and my clip on Notorious
Bitch, I'm the man, no, the Mandalorian
I'm in a DeLorean, nigga, I'm floorin' it
I got my whore in it, that bitch a foreigner
Pourin' her heart out, I'm just ignorin' her
I let my hair down, I'm finna go throw her
And bury myself in that pussy, no coroner
I can't smoke Reggie, I be too edgy
My bitch a veggie, bitch, I'm a legend
Pull out my flag, and these niggas start pledgin'
Go pull up whenever, we ain't gotta schedule it
Boy, I'm a president, presidential Rollie
Bezel it heavily, inspect it carefully
I'm smokin' like I'm in the Netherlands
Like I'm a hippie that's stuck in the 70s
You with your buddies, I'm with my bloodies
And this ain't no flag, lil' nigga, this rugby
Duct-tape that nigga up until he a mummy
Then put him in a freezer until we get hungry
Huh, I keep my foot on gas, bitch
Nigga, tell me where to go 
I shot the plug in the foot 'cause he was steppin' on the dope 
Since Allen Iverson, I been like Eric with the snow
Every time I'm O.T., my bitch cry like T.O. 
I keep my foot on gas, bitch
Nigga, tell me where to go 
I shot the plug in the foot 'cause he was steppin' on the dope 
Since Allen Iverson, I been like Eric with the snow 
Every time I'm O.T. , my bitch cry like T.O.
Cookin' dope in kitchen, 36 , I got chickens 
Got the bowl , I'ma whip it 
Got the pistol , get to clickin' 
Got the dope , got the scope 
Got the coke  off the boat
Got the grams, make it float
Ask my plug, "What's the quote?" 
I shoot at all of my enemies 
Walk around like I'm Yosemite 
Extra clip, that's my amenities 
I'ma send shots like a Hennessy 
Bitch, I'ma shoot like a penalty 
Keep me a flag like a penalty 
Niggas know me, O.T. 
I got more hook than parentheses 
Home Depot, keep me a toolie

I'm not scared of the dark
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall

Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
I'm not scared
I'm not scared, neither are the stars
I'm not scared of the dark
Of the dark, mmm
Yo no le temo a la oscuridá'
Aunque es más poderosa la maldá'
To'a las noches se presta, la vida cobra lo que da
No quiere decir que la luz no te la da
Pero mi beba 'tá mejor cuando me visto y salgo cuando el sol se va
No tengo enemigo' oculto', de una los sepulto
Siempre con el bien, feliz de ver hermano' junto'
Lo que pasa en el mundo ya no e' justo
Tiene que venir alguien pa'cá a resolver un par de asunto', oh

Of the dark, mmm
Tunechi
I ain't never scared and I ain't never horrified
I just look down at my Rolex, it said it's the darkest times
I ain't never terrified, I ain't never petrified
You know I see dead people, I just tell 'em, "Get a life"
I ain't never scurred, I'm not sure if that's a word, but
I mean every word, feelin' like "do not disturb," wait
Let me testify, I have never testified
And I'm married to my pride, I ain't never, never cried
I got eyes like marbles, if I cry they sparkle
You know I can read your mind like I'm the author
There's a line for tomorrow and that line's gettin' shorter
I'm behind the trigger, what if I am the target?
Deep sigh, a sayōnara, I ain't afraid to die
It's either goodbye or good mornin', and the skies start to fallin'
And I'ma shine in the darkness
I look back down at my Rollie, it says "Time for the chorus"
You know I'm not scared
I'm not scared of the dark
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
I'm not scared, not at all
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?

She say she want me, oowee
Okay, lil' shawty, let's do this, come on
If I could count the tears I've cried
A million times, I swear I've died
I'm trying, but it's still not right
The only time I want her is tonight
I'm not scared of the dark
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
I'm not scared, not at all
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?

"It was never my intention to desecrate the flag of the United States of America. I was shooting a video for a song off my album entitled "God Bless Amerika". The clip that surfaced on the Internet was a camera trick clip that revealed that behind the American Flag was the Hoods of America. In the final edit of the video you will see the flag fall to reveal what is behind it but will never see it on the ground. In most people eyes including my own who were raised in that environment, the Hood is the only America they know and the only America I knew growing up. I was fortunate from my God given talents to escape the Hood and see the other beautiful places this country has to offer but most people who are born in that environment don't get that chance. That's their view of their America. That was Dwayne M Carter from Hollygrove New Orleans view of America. That's who I'm speaking for in this song".Look right here, this how we gon do this
Hook up the turn tables, whoof get on the keyboard
And we gon run this for you, ya heard?

Ay, let me slide in the Benz with the fished-out fins

Copped baby girl what she desired
It's chump change ma, marijuana scholar
Know'n what I got up in my styrofoam cup - that purple stuff
It was given to me at birth to stunt
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the furry cups
Hey, hold on mami them whips on dubs
Cadillac Truck, 28's, no rubs
Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eyed lens
Car show in New York, y'all know who wins
It's the Birdman daddy, with the Gucci Prada
Slant back Cup Truck, no rims - can't holla
It's that Louie Fendi on Ostrich streets
It's the tailor-made daddy, mami do you love me?
Baby, I'm a stunna

Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no
Pop one, pop two with the new Nike shoes
Royal blue jag on 'em 22's
Slippers, white to breate, 500 Degreez
In that Cadillac Truck on 'em 23's
I'm the boss of the game with the money and fame
All these, naked women that pop champagne
And these, marble floors stay high as Rick James
If you know my name then you know my game
It's lil whoadie from the hot block with serious flow
Gotta get dough, cha'll won't feel me broke
But, y'all don't hear me though
Til I'm rolling down my window where my grill is show
And you know I probably pump it through the hood on them 24's
Word, rims poking out the side of the err
Glock, have ya ribs poking out the side of your shirt
I'm a 17 nigga and I ride through the turf
Baby, I'm a stunna
I ain't gon change it
Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no
Hey, and my pinky glow cause my rings is so...

And we don't stop, nah, we blow
Fuck the pee-ple
Everywhere we go we smell like ick yo
Birdman, my Paw so that make me go.. fly like an eagle, fasheezy
See they think cause I stay English turn
That stunna don't ever OZ to burn

Cars on my streets, all on the lawn
Ice in my teeth, all on my arm
Tats in my face, my back and my arm
Tats in my face, my back and my arm
Baby, I'm a stunna

Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?

Oh yeah, believe that
Who we rollin wit?

Piece of mind, ya know
Piece of something, motherfucker!Uh, yeah, yeah
Hot Spitta, Spitta, Fly Society
Young Money y'all, Young Money y'all
Yeah
Figured it's time that I step back from the game
And peep it from a coach's point of view, so I can see
How niggas went wrong and how the players was wrong
And I can do it how a pro supposed to do
No mistakes allowed, you get caskets for that shit
The line of scrimmage is waiting
Niggas is blitzing, you could get sacked quick
Drop back like an all-star QB
Or the top on that high-end sports car with two seats
You niggas don't comb the pages of the duPont Registry
Looking for vehicles and accessories
Like I do, and every representor of my crew
I get love from Cuz and the Piru
Slide through the drive through of a fast food restaurant
Turn the music down and tell the broad what kind of sauce I want
Scratch off quickly to a main street, intentions to make cheese
Let the windows down and let the purp' scent clear out
The police is peeping me and they don't think that I can see
I know they gon' pull me over and make me get out
But I'm on to 'em
Spray the chronic-killer and talk calm to 'em
"Good day officer, what's the problem?"
You looking for answers? I don't got none
I'm from New Orleans and New Orleans don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, I'm getting money nigga
Haha, I know that's right
Hello world, yeah
Yeah, uh-huh, Music to Fly To coming soon, y'all
You can see me on the Eastside of New Orleans with a red bitch
Fuck the world, make it walk with a leg twitch
Flow retarded, I'm on some Special Ed. shit
The magnificent, twist it like a dread, bitch
And I can get up in the car and drive
And if the record is a smash, I can still survive
Yeah, money ain't a thing but everything to me
Shit, I gotta make them C-notes sing to me
Yeah, higher than all of the angels be
And, no I never choke but I strangle beats
And, I am just a player in this game we be
So go blame the referee, don't complain to me
And I used to have a cutlass on stainless feet
Passin' all day up Latoya's Street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Had me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedaling my ten-speed bike
Who knew I'd be pedaling the six-speed white
Big dog through the yard where the little dogs bite
So if you are female dog, you don't fight
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga, I got all my masters
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga...Yeah
Stop playin' with me
Cannon in my hand
And I'll be damned
If any man
Disrespect me on my land
Intercept a nigga plans
An effective ass nigga
I'm a f-f-fireman, but I'll wet that ass nigga
My vessel pump liquor, I'm a special-ass nigga
No frontin' I'm in front of these extra-last niggas
I'm a extra bad nigga, I'm a sideways shooter
Open up the Maserati
Fuck the highway troopers
'Cause nowadays dudes'll
Run and tell the troopers
So I hope that same trooper could
Find you when I lose ya
Hey, these niggas talkin' at the side of they medullas

Let me do your medulla, pop your oblongata, call a doctor

Diamond baguette bracelets for my lovers
Player, I use Cristal to lubricate rubbers
Who got shit on his wrist that cost three nickel
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slanging pickle
Who got a Benz, a Prowler, playboy, and a 'Vette
Tell the truth -- who fucked you on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mamas from the N.O. to New York
Who got every bitch's attention in this motherfucker when he talk
Now who the fuck we talking about, look -- y'all dont know?

Well go 'head on and gimme some head
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life

So that's our life
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night

Nigga came back with a hell of a price
That ain't nothing, these hoes doing hella wrong
Calling these niggas on our cell phone
Bitch riding Benz on 20-inch chrome
Give me the key, the car, ho, and the alarm
For my Prowler, my Jag, my Benz and my home
Bitch you'll never ride 20-inch chrome
I love to shine, that's why the chopper's mine
Hit my block in my Benz, ho, with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive
Bought it to tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the Bose system right behind my eyes
With the VC's and TV's so a nigga could shine
Let my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they don't need no job
Loud pipes big rims
Wodie that's our life
When we pull up at the club
Sorry that's our night
I know a lot of haters out there saying

I ride the best, from a Benz, to a Jag, to a Beamer, to a Lex
Might fly first class on Delta, helicopter or a jet
I'm a stunter, I'm a repper, Geezy like to shine
Drink Don, Moët, and Crissy, see that's the finest wine
20 inches is the only thing I sit my shit on
Don't bring yo bitch around me cause my dick she'll wanna sit on
And I ain't gonna tell her nothing different, that's your issue
But after she come back, your best out is not to kiss her
Whole city sayin damn, look at Fresh pinky ring
Look at B.G. watch, that bitch bling-a-ling-a-ling
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never
See me sporting nothing that ain't 20 G's or better
Me and Wayne take the left, Juve and Baby take the right
It's dark in the room, we hold up our watches and it's light
Cash Money Millionaires living a hell of a life
Like my nigga Weezy said, we surrounded by ice
Loud pipes big rims

Lamborghini sitting on broaders with two more in my garages
Plus a blue and black ferrari with Nintendo and Atari
Man I swear the car is awesome, vroom! Sorry, we lost 'em
I'm back, I pull up smelling like dime sacks and cognac
I leave in the Hummer, hour later I'm flying back
Whoosh, private jet's about to land
The women fall out when I let them touch my hand
I get out the plane into a Mercedes Benz van
TVs all over with chrome 20-inch fans, damn
Goddamn, man, I am, L-I-L, Weezy, off the heezy
But still in awe, ice floodin' on my watch
And in my grill and all, Porsche Box', front blocks

My respect level now is unheard of
Niggas was laughin', now they wish they never heard of 'em
Now they gon' learn to respect me, bruh
I lick a shot, 9 millis get burned in their retina
Have that lead come out the back of your head
One word is what I said, click clack and you're dead
Put one more of them claps in the back of your leg
I hit ya arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Damn, if you was just a virgin to Pain
Just think of me as the R&B version of Wayne
But since he doin' the same thing now it's no difference
Ice grill, hood niggas put your dentures in
He so sweet make her wanna lick the singer
So me and Weezy gang bang her
Pullin' on my roots, I had to hang her, whip her
Tallahassee dick her, I'm back on the map
'Cause he rap, he sang, and he do, his thang
And he does, we does everything you wish you was
It's T-Wayne, it's T-Pain
Bang, bang, yeah
He rap, he sang he do, his thang
He does, we does everything you wish you was
It's T-Wayne, alright, bang, bang
Weezy, oh, oh

Baby I'm a trapper turned rapper turned sanger
Darlin', suwoo to the bangers
And if you want beef, I'll cook that angus 
Thank God I'm famous
'Cause a lot of these ballers'd be around here chainless
But I made bling bling, yeah, ching, ching
And these sorry-ass rappers make a nigga wanna sing
I'm in love with a stripper
And I send shots like the bartender
And I'm like bitch, ain't me, get in line with the rest
'Cause even the best say Weezy the best
Okay shawty, you ain't messin' with  a Li'zane nor Wizane
Just a Lil Wayne and a whole lot of Pain
You know what I'm sayin'? Like
I'm mind rockin' models with a bottle, if you can't swallow
Shut up, bitch, gargle, that's the motto, holla
He rap, he do, he does
Everything you wish you was, it's T-Pain, baby
He rap, he do, he does
Everything you wish you was, it's T-Pain, babeMommas oldest, dads brightest
But youngin still thugging
What was it that bad guidance
Love him he's God gift
Though they hate I love it
It make me drive faster
They won't catch the F50 Ferrari
I got on Ferrari glasses
Mashing through New Orleans like it's Cali
I'm just trying to keep up with the fashions
Got my music blasting
Televisions flashing
I'm watching The Passion
Me I get my hot box game up when I flame up
Shame lil niggas at the red light change up
See everyone was around when I was down
Now it's lonely at the top since I came up
Look up, they trying to look me up and hook up look
I ain't got a nose for your boogers I'm sugar
That mean I'm good, if you is I'm gooder
Should of would of could of but you didn't cocksucker
This is that old south I'm talking with that old slang
Pushing that new thing, shitting on my old hoes
Pissing off my old homies
The game is fair but it's cold get your winter garmets
Still can't warm it
See I'm a break from the norm
My LA girls they say I’m so bomb, they eat tofu
The 40/40 on a special day
Them cheap niggas I'll still slide 500 to Desiree
I talk shit and I don't never hate
Cause I would forklift whoever face
See I ain't rich yet
Oh but I'm ballin now and that get your bitch wet
We just trying to see how many dicks she can bench press
See I'm a business
Dogs I’m a bitchness
I ain't a rest haven I let the rest save them
Mack Maine hit me with the trap game
Now I'm having second thoughts about the fucking rap game
Hold up
Tez
Please get on my schedule let them know that I'm open
Pick a day when I'm free and put “beef”
C'mon, let them know I'm hoping they tripping
We could get it in motion you get to know physics
Leaving them in the ocean with pistols dripping
With all these bannana clips and we ain't slipping
Foggy behind the tints, good grief
So you blow o's of the leaf I blow a wreathe
Sheesh, Great Scott, is he a theif?
It seems like he got a mouth full of gold teeth
Chyea, shout out to Cee Lo Green
Young money we know green
Spitta say you no crazy
We got shit that you don't need
That's my nigga he fly, so now he keep me fly
And all the talk in the streets bout us is we be fly
My bitch be asking why I don't go suit and tie
Because they put that on you when you dieIntro:
Stepping to the bad side 
Gonna take a mean ride 
The smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay
Stepping to the bad side today
Real nigga, I just can't be fake
Fake niggas they just can't be real
Hot boy I just can’t be chilled
So hot I'm a walking kettle
Man these boys can’t get on my level, they never could
All white phantom directing it through the hood
Real soft leather my dash is cherry wood
Big four 5th that’s working very good
Got a driver named Wood-row
Opens the door, Sui - ci - dal
He holds the umbrella, I hops outta the back
And tell Rosa Parks it’s where I sat
I'm a dog but I'm like a cat to a rat
If he don’t run he get scratched Rrrrraaaaooo
And when it comes to the 4 stain
I'm like old school Harlem shit, that Rich Port thang
I gave him narc
I gave him crack
Now it’s time to introduce him to morphine
You're playing with the wrong one
My mama had 4 boys, you're playing with the wrong son
They say Ladies Love Cool J
Well the J is for Juelz and the ladies love me
And if the bitch ain’t fine
I don’t mind
2 nickels make a dime every time
These boys acting like worthless hoes
But their career is like the car they be in, the curtains closed
They want war let’s get it now
They want beef I give them a cow
You don’t wanna get on my bad side
I leave them with no neck like fat guys
Don’t be playing with me, I ad-vise
I make them Chinese food, another cat fried
And don’t compare them to me there is no comparison
I'm from another planet like aliens
Shark In The Water, there is no scaring them
These fish belong in aquariums
So keep acting like Conan boy and we will see who is the real barbarian
They acting like bad pets and yes I'm a veterinarian
You don’t wanna see me act mean
And don’t watch me I'm not a flat screen
I'm Pay-Per-View you know what that means
You gotta pay for this BITCH!!
Let’s Go
Hard body I can’t even bend
Nor fold I'm cold like the wind
Or North Pole I froze all my limbs
Too much ice I'm a walking bezzle

And I'm rolling on this bitch like I popped a pill
And I don’t mean David, when I say it, when it comes to marijuana I will cop a field
Just tryna get my proper meal and eat my shit at the top of the hill
That’s the good side
Never look back it’s ya bad side
You on the bad side
Hey, and you don’t wanna see my bad side
You would wanna be my ally
And I believe that I can fly
Not like R.Kelly, he a damn lie

Free my nigga Meek Mill!

Umm to help these multiple generations that look at me as the reason they started rapping or the reason why they rap and into music is ... uh ... it's unexplainable. There isn't a word for it. You can't describe the feeling. Um if there, you know what I mean, there's words that's probably close to it, and when I say close I mean light years away from it, words like amazing, awesome, that's probably the closest, and like I said, that's light years away from the feeling, you know what I mean. I can't explain it, it's crazy just to turn on the television, just to see my own children walk inside and be like, you know what I mean, singing something you know like what is you talking about right now, what are you singing, what are you listening to on that iPad, what are you watching? And they be like "such and such" and I be like, you know, what is that, and they be like, you know what I mean, "he loves you Daddy, he loves you Daddy, he always shouting you out Daddy, he always..." and that's when they put me on, you know what I mean.

You love it
Girl I gotta take off
Cause I'mma be here next week
So call your company
& take off
Oh oh oeh oh oh eh
Cause she say "Wayne Wayne"
So she got me all impatient
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscious
While I say aloud
Hook: Dre
Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin no one, but yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin no one, but yourself
And so shes gone to party town
On her own
And you go by yourself
So all alone
I told her I can be with her
But I can't be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much
Thats the problem
"Oh my god" then
Shorty be whillin
And when I say I got to leave
You wouldn't believe
All of the things
That she'll do
And all of the things
She'll say to make me stay
And I be like "damn"
I've been that boy for forever
I'll be back someday
But she wanna go with me to outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way
& then I send her on her way
Hook: Dre
And now she's not pickin' up the phone
I don't know what to do
Thinking about going to her home
Landing my spaceship on her roof
Going through her bedroom window
Only to find a mans shoe on the floor
Ohhh noo, ohhh noo, ohhh noo
And I'm like
"Who am I to blame?"
When she was pleading "Wayne
If you ever leave again
I don't wanna see you anymore."
Hop back in my space ship
Hope that I don't spot you at all
Eh eh oh
Because baby if I see you
I'mma probably knock your ass out
Eh eh oh
Put you in the trunk
Throw him over the bridge, and take off
Hook: DreHavin' too much fun
Like, too much fun together to just
Ya know?
Everybody gotta have a little fun on the side
Everybody gotta have a little fun on the side
I can't wait until she my bitch
Cause right now I'm just her side bitch
She got a nigga she can ride with
But got the nerve to put me in although that's my dick
Damn...
Lord I'm so tired of being her side bitchNo, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake
She got a pussy like the Garden of Eden
I tip-toe through the tulips
And I'ma do me, scratch me off my to-do list
I got flies all on my new shit
Loose lips sink the cruise ship
Even gigabyte get their two chip
Havin' a pillow fight with a cute bitch
With a body like a belly dancer
She say you scared of this pussy cat, well if that's a panther
I hope it's pink, I read her mind, yeah I read every chapter
Sit on this dick, feel like you flyin' on a pterodactyl
I ain't got time to play no games
Gimme mind, don't play no games
She say she'll slit me if I'm vain, I said "objection, sustained"
This shouldn't affect my affection
She say she sent from Heaven
That's why all flights were connected
I still use protection, if she's a blessing in disguise
But I swear it's a damn good disguise, because I can't tell
She wish she had me on lock
But there's so many other niggas doin' time
In her brain cells, damn, uh
No, no, staying awake
Am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
No, no, staying awake
Uh, am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
My heart beat echoes 'cause my insides are hallow
If anyone have a towel, wipe the guilt off my face
My high's comin' down like my stilts about to break
She tell shit I never heard when I thought I heard it all
Like you perfect but not flawless but you got the perfect flaws
And what goes around, comes around, out a swirly straw
Then she put that shit on me, I feel like some dirty draws
She say "just don't leave me Wayne, 'cause life is short"
I say "I'm touched but baby, pimpin' ain't a contact sport"
She dyed her hair, I asked her "when's the funeral?"

She gon' be singin' the blues, hope she could hit them high notes
Pour me a drink of some few and let me spit on this ho

Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you
Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you
Knew I would pull out my heart and bring it right to you
You knew all about me, baby
But you wasn't about me, baby, damn...
Young Wayne, prepare for change
'Cause it seems like girlie don't care the same
You had my chain, you beared my name
Then, we had champagne
Let's drink a toast
To you and me
Let's drink a toast to our love
And the way it's supposed to be, oh, oh, oh, oh
Other people telling me I fell off
Other people telling me; I felt y'all
Mama tellin' me I should at least call
My mind tellin' me, "She should at least call"
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seesaw
Felt like I was at the bottom of the seashore
But you got to let her be, boy
And when you open up your eyes, I hope you see more
And when I see you, I see detours
Don't need to be depressed anymore
Baby girl, I need more
Now, run your mouth 'til your knees sore
Let's talk it over, let's talk it over, let's talk it over now
Let's talk it over, let's talk it over, let's talk it over now
Let's talk it over, let's talk it over, let's talk it over now
Ugh, five karats on her finger, got her hand smitten
But everybody get a ring, even Scottie Pippen
Everybody got a thing, but I guess mine isn't
What my vision
So I just sits in my Lamborghini, let my top vibe with me
Kick back and get high with me, chyeah
And if she still get me
I hope my wife know she got a playa for life
And that's no bullshitting, heh
I push love to its full limits
Do a hundred-ninety in the lane called "Memory"
And I know you in that lane with me
But when the light change, you didn't change with it
And now, I'm honking my horn
Got to get that dead grass off of my lawn
As I mose' on
The champagne's never froz-on, as it pours on the floor
Let's drink a toast
To you and me
Let's drink a toast to our love
And the way it's supposed to be, oh, oh, oh, ohWe over here hustlin', we over here grindin'

I got the key to success, get money invest
Re-up with the rest. I got a Swedish connect
That means my weed is the best, homie, even the stress
OK, the coupe is ridiculous and the jeep is a mess
Let's call my bullets a lump, I put 'em deep in your neck
Adam's apple meet banana clip
You know my script, I just get my chips and then I dip, and then I dip
They say the bullshit walks, the money talks

Birdman Junior, number one stunna my partner
You know the name, bitchShe said her name was Lisa Marie
And she was a beast
Woman so bad, it's illegal to speak
She say she like me and she was eager to meet
And I was just as eager as eager as she
Body so sick you can eat off her feet
Go to the hospital, die in a week
She say she was a model, well obviously
'Cause I can sure picture her between my sheets
Baby was a flower with rose pedal cheeks
And every time she talk it's like a gold medal speech
Intelligent, she should teach
And if so
I will be a nerd like screech
I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track, she said, "That's deep"
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat
This is the beat, this is, this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She- she- she said her name was Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was discreet
Her picture's in the dictionary next to elite
I told her we can get away we can retreat
Cut off my arms put 'em on her seat
Cut off my legs put 'em on her head
So I could run through her mind like she does mine
And every time she smile it make me feel like a child
In the supermarket on the candy aisle
I saw a picture of her with her panties down
I fall asleep and dream, I'm a camera now
I would love to be the water in her shower
Or one of her bath towels
I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track, she said, "That's deep"
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat
This is the beat, this is, this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She- she- she said her name was Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
She said her name was Lisa Marie and she was a piece
A piece of fine art like a piece of the leak
She was unique, exquisite
Like x y z, she was complete
And I think she like butterflies
Because she got one on her upper thigh
And her face is like summertime
Birthday the same month as mine with a different sign
Virgo, I go wherever her go
If she say so I'm on her like a fur coat
In November, she colder than December
She got me fallin' like timber
I told her I would write a rhyme about her and it would be sweet
I said I need the perfect track, she said, "That's deep"
I worked on it all night didn't get no sleep
Now here is my song and this is the beat
This is the beat, this is, this is the beat
And here is my song about Lisa Marie
She- she- she said her name was Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa Marie
Li- Lisa MarieHolla at ya boy its Weezy Baby
They label me a problem and I probably am so I dont knock em
I pop up in a broccoli Lam' on choppers
With an ol' school bitch, she got on door knockers
And she knock on your door for that raw partner
Hollygrove Wayne, that boy a monster
Jacked for a Mazda come back in Mase-rati
Like how he? Why he? Cause I be
Moving through the city like an I.V
Tryna be monogamous but I got bitches on my dick
Like I'm the shit cause I'm the shit
So I only promise this: to my little girl I will give you the world
And to my unborn I'm tryna reason with ya moms so
If I'm not with her when you get here, its already clear
Yeah, and for their sake I'm a ball every year
I'm a pause every tear
And tattoo it on my face
Niggas know, that I got that black music on my waist
Make me put it to your ear and get that b-b-b-b-bass
Bluka bluka to ya face, closed casket
Mama can't remember shit but last saturday, what a tragedy
Flowers for the family
Powder in my nap sack
Running through the projects, tryna get a stack back
I got my SK bout to get my MAC back to pap pap at niggas who yap yap
Yup yup! and I rep that 17 hard, you know
'til a nigga ain't nothing but tomb quotes
Raw Tune, who you know go harder than dude
See these is the clues, part of my shoes
I bleed with them dudes I'm part of the crew
Don't move cause you right in the route of the gun mouth
When it talk, you know what come out- barreltone
Nigga y-y-young Wayne from out Carrollton
Yeah, I got my eyes on the sparrow
Though my path is narrow, my angels are shadows
I saddled up, and get the fucking battle
Automatics up, like nigga fuck whoever
You touch and reach, you get fucking bleached
Above the law niggas put you underneath
You call the law nigga? You fucking leech!
You Saved by the Bell, you fucking Screech
My bucket screech through the streets like a R&B singer
You ain't pimping until you fuck a R&B singer
I walked in this building with all these bangers
And all these niggas look like targets to me
What's a drought to you may be a bargain to me
Cause I just may be sitting on a carton of Ki's
I got important people thats trying to market me
So I'm gon' stop talking 'bout the white, Sike!
I know I'm not walking without a fight
So I'm swinging with all my might
We can go all night
I'm a blow all day, and I'm a blow all night
Do a verse today and do a show tonight!
Fuck a ho today, and fuck a ho tonight!
Im' a live my life like there's no tonight
I might go tonight so mama pray don't cry
Cause your prayers maybe working, mama they gon' try
Yeah,and we rock to the same lullaby
Nigga I got 10, nigga I got 5

I've been knocked down but I managed to improve
Only real competition is myself

And when I hit the ground I sunk
Yeah they thought I was down, I'm up
I was lost now I'm found, what's up
I came too far around to give up
When I was down on my dick
Everybody was missing, they thought I would miss them
But I got in that kitchen and cooked up this wisdom
I started a system

They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of, keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up, I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to Heat it up

Baby this is what we do
Yeah, what you want
And if you strapped, we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on

Life ain't cheap, you're better off dead

Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South
When, they ain't runnin a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin
It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin for a livin
It's more because of what I do and how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
 And still chillin on somethin that's into healing
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day
You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do
They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wrong and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? 
'Fore you knock the boy, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin tight, there's limits on the ave
Tryin to cop or shot-call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover upListen up, Princess
I wake up in the morning
Take a knee and thank God
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eye
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Neither the day before that, nor before that
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak
And know that I do miss ya
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya
Since you've been gone, I've been all alone
But alone is steroids, cuz it made me strong
Girl, hurr gone in the wind
You cheated on God's son
Baby girl, that's a sin
But I forgive you
But I can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rear-view
And I put that ring on your finger
I was all in
But now it's just a symbol of what could've been
Goddamn
And now I'm by myself, but 
Damn, she left me all by myself, but 
Yo, I love my niggas; no homo

When you see a real nigga, you gotta tip yo hat
And since I'm a real nigga, I do just that

War is the answer if ya questioning the general
Snap shots at you baby you are just a centerfold
And less Kenny Cole, niggas seem plenty bold
Pull that bitch out alright don't make me get my fishin' pole
Them niggas hoes, really doe
I would swing down there with any O, Forty-Fo' and let 'em go
Let 'em know, that I ain't never been sweet and won't be

Thomas bitch I promise I'll kill ya and that's a fact
And I ain't never killed no one, Jack
But I'm honest bitch I promise I'll kill ya and that's a fact I am living the game, hitting the fades, quick cash
Blink too fast you'll be gone, no quicksand
This man ain't givin a fuck for no middle man, middle class

And I was just a boy like killer cam

I'm with my pack and we attack like bears
And we can go anywhere like air
Motherfuckin' temper shiftin like bike gears
Head high, I got the world on my back they told me I can turn around, but never look down
They told me if I shoot the AK I better aim down
They say even a train collision produces the same sound
I said, wow!
And I went and got two too
So you better be listenin' for that choo choo
Soowoo!
I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on
Big city terrorizers, you can bet some dollars 
My guns touch kids like pedafilers
I stretch your mouth I'm the excersizor
Gun in his mouth like a breathalizer
Swallow lead saliva, you ain't straight I'mma 12 o'clock ya
Niggas pour cement on your body and cinder block ya
But I really think they shocked at how clear my rocks are
Why my neck look like shots of vodka 
Them boys don't want it with me,
I'm on that rah rah, uh huh, they sweet like peach, cobla
My bills gotta be paid, my kid gotta get fed
So if a nigga gotta lay down I'm making his bed
So I hope he like his sheets red,
Medium rare I hope he like his meat red, braaap!
You see my homies dressed in deep red
They scramble niggas hope you eat eggs
Onefiftyfirst bitch!

I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun on
They say God protect fools and babies
I'm a G, so I depend on my tool for safety
I roll on niggas like skate key
Skate broads, Tony Hawk on a skateboard
Who fucking with me?
With arm on the wheel, with arm on the steel
Could it be I'm crazy, Gnarls Barkley forreal
You play dumb and you lay numb
Face  like when  demo tapes come
The world is so happy and my gun is too
So how I can take a life when it's dark in the room
When that means it's nighttime so I talk to the moon
And it tells me that I'm flier than the stars on a broom
Yes I'm wicked 
And I don't care what niggas say nor what bitches said
We like green all got a different bread
Push my eraser and I will give you lead
I ain't really the nigga you gon really wanna front on
I put your whole life on your front lawn, come on
Stunt on some shit that none on, gun onCut the lights off nigga 
You know what time it is

All of a sudden all these cowards
Startin to spook out
It's warfare a buncha of niggas
Bout to lose out
It's time to load up them thangs
Hit the spot run in his house
And make 'em show up then thangs
Take 'em in the room go in his pockets
And then blow up his brains

And got my Glocks rammin'
Leave a nigga spot damaged
That's how the beat made us

So I can get a head rush
Then come around the corner
And your whole day crush

Some of 'em scared of man slaughter
So they stay inside
And watch they partners get lit up
And then they ask why?

On the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit
Choppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick

Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid

Ain't nothin' sweet cause I can't keep trust
Lil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga
Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga
Better hide the kids nigga parents and all
Wayne 'bout to damage your home
Look up out the window, see the man and his dawgs
Hoppin' out the van with bandanas and all
Cannons went off
News cameras takin' pictures of your family when your abdomen’s gone
Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain
How the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame
That's because she ran into the game
Nigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne
Come on!
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was

Runnin' with them cats that be clappin' the plastic
Nigga put a cap in your asses
Catch me on the ave with the crack and a 'matic
Hopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it
First of the month, just snatched me a package
Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'
If a nigga think about jackin', please believe
I be clip-slappin', click-clackin'
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents
Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him
Shit get drastic
That's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could
Grab me a freak to eats on my wood
Transport coke from each of my hoods
Weezy Wee - CMB's in my blood
Eagle Street 17's where I'm from
And I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens
Scrilla, Dough, fetticheese is my love
You know the streets made me
And I don't give a damn if you hate me
Nigga better be S-Q-A-D
Until the day the man do take me
Squad shit!
You don't want no violence to keep the quiet
We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet
Or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma
So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence
Come on! What!

You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Them can't fuck with me now - ah, they can't fuck with me now
Look-
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was

And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
They can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood

I promise I will be the man
Swim until I see the sand
Then die soon as I reach the land
The water's over our hands
What happened to our plans?
Swim until I see the sand
Then die soon as I reach the land!
This is my resurrection, so fuck your resolution
I don't need no protection, I don't need your confusion
Don't know what to believe, don't know what to believe
Don't know what to believe, don't care what you believe!
Cause I'm so over you, yeah I'm so over you
Yeah I fly over you, cause I'm so over you
I did everything by the book, book, book
Scribbling all over all of the notes that I took, took
Find that you're no better than a crook, ooh!
Set and developed I felt I could trust you, struck
Showed them a picture of my ID
That's not enough to prove that it's me
Look in the mirror, now who should I be-lieve?
This is my resurrection, so fuck your resolution
I don't need no protection, I don't need your confusion
Don't know what to believe, don't know what to believe

I know the whole New Orleans got my back
Get the dirt off my shoulders and clean up my act
This that C5, thank you Jesus, I'm back
'Cause there's only one I, don't remove that eye patch
Man, I got this whole fuckin' world on my back
It wasn't my hands but there's blood on my hands
Watch my fingers make a capital B
I throw gang signs up and don't care where they land
I know the whole 17 got my back
The backbone of my hood, I'm the spleen of my trap
I know some niggas that think it's Iraq
There is death in the air, you might catch a contact
You may need to shorten the lean after that
Man, I swear I drunk so much of lean, I almost passed
Not tryna say I've been clean after that
But let's just say that is a thing of the past
But can you picture the scene after that?
No more Lil Tunechi, no more king of rap
Life can be gone in a blink of an eye
Lord, I guess I just be blinkin' too fast
Oh but don't you judge me, judge the one in the mirror
In your bathroom found a sink full of glass
Just when they thought and they think I wouldn't last
I woke up and I just Carter Cinco'd they ass
Man, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas

All the parts of Godfather, all a part of me
If you look to the wall you see
A few gagged up, tied up, scared pricks

I ain't Jason at all but it get scary 'bout my chips 
And in here is where I keep the bricks
Acknowledge Lil Marley in the hallway

Always Trying 
To Keep It Under Control 
You Got It Down 
And You're Well On Your Way To The Top 
But There Is Something You Forgot
But I hope u haven't forgot about me
Up in the living room watchin sports center
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the lord is a forgiver
You know they say if u pray then u can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Why you even go and get a like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me butter, I called you babe
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say, please, don't worry about the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream. Damn
I've Been Lonely
I've Been Waiting For You
I'm Pretending, and That's All I Can Do
The Love I'm Sending Ain't Making It Through To Your Heart
I shed tears 'cause I'm told that they'll heal
To tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Ever felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave 'em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they ain't comin
Way back it was hoops, now it's Maybach coupes
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room
I'm laughin, cause it's lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattood by kartoo?
 by my rules we all lose
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fight
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, you would cry twice
To me you were the brightest star under sunlight
Take away my title, take away my stripes
And give me back my girl and you give me back my life
-Give me back my girl and you give me back my life-
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hoping she'd be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I could bring it back
What she means to me is what I mean to rap

But There Is Something You Forgot
Flippin through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin pictures of my jewels in the light
Hundred g's in the night, entertain big timers
Cause my 1 liners rule these dynamers
Smellin rosé on my breath, on ex brisco fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin lavish stackin mail up
Clothes come from big n tall …………?
Got live life, I'm tryna live life
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the Benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars
 
You've Been Hiding, Never Letting It Show

Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathom
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin 'em mighty daily
I know I'm under surveillance 
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin I'm such a threat to these n*ggaz 
I started without a coin, not knowin which way I'm goin
Now I'm chatering boeings n readin a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
And I never felt this way about anything in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success
I've Been Lonely
I've Been Waiting For You

The Love I'm Sending Ain't Making It Through To Your HeartI don't know about you, but uh

Married to the block, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you straight to the needle
The bottle, the battle, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband used to beat you?
Remember when I went into the kitchen got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck either
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
You could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
I am her voice and the world is my speaker
I'm speaking
Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall
Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall
With my spine up against these tagged up brickwalls
Flip grams, quick hand, quicksand, pitfalls
Big balls intact through error Syntac's
The stormy weather where the trees don't bend back
Left home at 16, I ain't never been back
When it come to being broke they say I never been flat
A punk ass bitch, I ain't never been that
Reminisce on daddy's caught a schlitz in his lap
And it's Newport Box with only one stick left
Snort heroine, then he shove me in his chest
Used to really believe I'll never be the best
Hell must be on my shoulder cause the devil sing the rest
Right on it through his bignes with them poisonous syringes
Beating on my mama, kick the door of the hinges
I wish I was old enough to stop him when he did it
So long ago, but even I can't forget it, so listen
Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall
Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall
Demonic in my presence, street corner like a reverend
Trying to find the change, shining lightining light in heaven
Triple 7, triple 6 - tribulations, triple trick
Triple grip, triple spitting like I had a triple lip
Let's make simple sense of the main difference
Angel of Death swing, got a sinner in a clench
Revolver in my fist, earthworm to a fish
Bait on the line, watch me catch 'em with this
Coke fly off compound, off round white rock
Balling like Earl Manigault in his high top
Third eye cyclops, beaten down my five cops
Left for dead and this ain't even my block
Thinking of my pops, thinking of my moms
Rather be just blazing listening to Saigon
Cause when you think up God strike you down
Body full of current, lightning never hit the ground
Living in a world a fantasy
His back against the wall
Living in a world a fantasyMy nigga Hood just walked in this bitch

So I Gotta Teach You The Proper Way Of Respect
When Youre Earning Money, Everybody Earns, Everybody Eats Bread
Its All About Cash Money Thats What Its All About Making The Money
So The First Thing Of Business Is This, You Remember Your Name
You Dont Forgets Your Roots

Too many thoughts on your mind
All the time, got you nervous
And you always read your horoscope
Tryna figure if the nigga that you talkin' to the one
And your friends say no, dealership say no
But fuck it you got a body that'll pay the car note
Thirty percent for the down payment
Pull out the lot girl now you famous
You on your own and your'e doin' just fine
Every check stub wanna buy you time
It ain't hard when you feel it
Cause' when you feel it you kill it
Your pride gone now you willin'
Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger
You all for the feeling
You all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
You all for the feeling
And you ain't never walked away from that feeling
Take a breath and say something
Go on ahead, talk about it
Money over discussion
Make a little something out of nothing
And all these promises, they all bluffing
Water the seed till the soils muddy
Uh, and every holiday you work
And when I have time you be at work
Damn, I guess you're looking for better
But I'm digging in that pussy like i'm lookin' for a treasure
And the feeling don't die if you don't let it, but you don't let it
That's why I give you credit, and today my lucky day
Today she doin' nothing, so when we get together
I put it in her stomach she say
Tunechi I feel it
She feel it when I kill it
Her pride gone now she willing
Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger
That it's all for the feeling
Say it's all for the feeling
Yeah you all for the feeling
You all for the feeling
And you ain't never walked away from that feeling
Take a breath and say something
Go on ahead, talk about the weeks
Talk about the months, talk about the pussy niggas
Man they all punks, live for the moment
Life ain't fair, sorry for the feeling
No grey hair, you ain't worried about nothing
Turn nothing into something
And never let that go
Tell the world they in danger
Even tell a stranger
You all for the feeling
Yeah you all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
God willing
You never walk away from that feeling
You all for the feeling
Yes you all for the feeling
Keep your head to the ceiling
Kill it when you feel it
Cause' you all for the feeling
Take a breath and say something
Girl lets talk about it
Mmm, yeah
But you ain't gotta say nothing
Because, your eyes say everything
They asked me why I did it
And I told em' it was all for the feelingDynamic, articulate, perceptive, courageous, outspoken
Just a few of the adjectives that so in adequately describe
Ahem, Mr. D. Carter
From out the deep water
Thank the lord for my voice, the beat, and the recorder
Now pick an alphabet and you're z'in'

Now let me in, I got my key in
And with them alphabets, I never used p-e-n
But I gotta lotta paper
But a lot ain't enough, so I got an occupation
Gotta bring the bacon, straight to the kitchen table
Homie if your girl pregnant, you should kiss her naval
Cause you probably won't live, to see the motherfuckin' cradle
Your past left a scar, and the future's lookin' fatal
You can't be sorry, you gotta be a savior
Gotta be the bread winner, so go rob the bread maker
When they put your homey to sleep, it's gotta be a wake up
You move in the hood, then you gotta meet the neighbors, damn
Bitch get off me
I'm the little ass nigga, known as big homie
The killas is ballin', the niggas is targets
The snitches is talkin', but this is New Orleans
I love what I got, I'm just livin' the moment
I ain't dyin' just yet, I'll take a shit in the coffin
I already know how to piss in the toilet
I'm tryin to get the pot to piss in in the mornin'
I never fall back, I'd rather go forward
And when I come through you betta duck like Howard
Because I got power, just like a forward
I come through the lane, and straight dunk like Stoude-

Dis-re-spect and I spit fire
To your neck and back like you are Khia

Big dog talkin', check the pedigree, flees 
And I ball like every team

One circle, three fingers is the theme
And young money motherfucka is the teamOhh, this feel good, alright, Ye

That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before
Okay, put your hands up if you did it before
Now your girl lookin' at you cause she didn't hell know
And now everybody sayin' that you did it before
And you know that's because they probably did it before
Cause if they did it before it would be different though
I wonder if Tammy knows, that I did it before
With Nisa, I wonder if she didn't hell know
That we did it before I know they did it before
The day we did it but oh, if they did it before
And we did it before, we can get it fa' sho
Cause if she with it, I know she should be with it fa' sho
I'm a tear that pussy up, like I didn't before
And after I did it they be history though
When I see em I act like I didn't hell know
That we did it before like we didn't before
But we did it before, hehe
Okay

That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before
Yeah, so if you did it before, be a pro
You gotta act like you didn't before
And everytime I meet a girl
They say that she didn't before
You know I gotta act like I never did it before
But she would be dumb if she didn't hell know
Cause I did it before and she will be dumb
If she think that I didn't, hell know
That she did it before, she probablly didn't go low
So we did it some more and we did it some more
Like Busta Rhymes said, she holla "give me some more"
So we did it some more, yeah, we did it til' four
And when four-o-one came, she was hittin the door
Not fixin' to go but she was hittin' the door
And I was probably butt naked just twistin' an O
Then I call my homies up, kick the shit how it go
And I know they gon' laugh cause they did it before
Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before
Okay, a lot of folks don't like to say they did it before
Wishin' that everybody didn't hell know
That they did it before, like if they did it'd be low
Or if they did it with more, than one, or did it for dough
Well if you didn't, then so, be cool with it and flow
And just rock with everybody, that done did it before
I know I did it before, you know you did it before
How come you ain't with it now, but you was with it before
Oh, that's your best friend, yeah, ya'll kick it I know
Ya'll probablly did it before, she probably licked it before
Like it was liquid before, yeah, I can vision you both
Like I done did it before cause I done did it before
Okay

But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before

That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it beforeThe first time I realized I was the best rapper alive
You know what I mean, now before I go into any further in this conversation
Let me let y'all know what I mean about this best rapper alive shit
I don't think I'm better than anybody personally
I don't think I'm better than anybody spiritually
Nahhmean, I don't think I'm better than anybody in any way or form or fashion
But as far as this rap thing, I think I am better than everybody
I'm a competitor, I hope everybody else feels the same way about their craft
You know what I mean, if you do it makes it better for the people
It makes it better for the listeners dawg
And that's how I feel about mine
So, if you're listening and you wanna hear somebody that's dedicated to what they do
I'm so dedicated that I feel I'm the best
See I can understand that
Niggas be saying "Drama, why you talk so much shit on your mixtapes?"
When you're not grinding I'm grinding to get where I'm at
You understand, believe that
And I won't be saying that I'm the best, but I run this
Hah, Dedication 2, that's right, you already...
Wake up motherfuckers it's Weezy, you got a problem?
Heads to them Katrina victims, we still mobbin'
Shiny black coupe at night look like a goblin

See y'all niggas ain't playing close attention right now
Ay Drama, this is what I want you to do man
This is what I really need you to do right now
My nigga Drama, plus he be hitting y'all in the head with that gangster shit
But listen, my nigga Drama man I swear I need you to do
I need you to give me something else for ya now
Just to warm 'em up, and then they gonna...I met her when I was young and she was younger
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing
I had to get her number
After how she made them daisy dukes fit her all summer
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer
And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didn't come easy
'Cuz she ended up being my baby's mother
And then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix...laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers dont know shit
Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
She screamed to me 
My love, my patience, my pain 
Nigga please
I got the young'n blues y'all 
I got the young'n blues y'all 
I got the young'n blues y'all 
I got the young'n blues y'all 
I met her after the fame
And she ain't even like me but I got her after the game
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good...I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange
And it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin
What more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard...I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life...the picture flipped
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit 
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep it..she ain't want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody
I got the young'n blues y'all 
I got the young'n blues y'all 
I got the young'n blues y'all 
I got the young'n blues y'all 
You see I never really ran, but no gentleman
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am
I'm just tryna be Weezy
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy
'Cuz all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do
And please consider that
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes
Love pussy but you dont love them ho's
Love ya niggas love ya children
Now if they got a bitch you could love that
Holla back
I got the young'n blues y'all 
I got the young'n blues y'all 
I got the young'n blues y'all

Get my EA sports on, ya know wat I'm talking bout?
Yea
Verse 1:
I got a bus like John Madden baby
We can go all around the world
I never talked to them boys that sat on them benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And I'ma leave them boys at the line of scrimmage
Yeah I see these boys all behind me winless
I ain't Mario Williams but I'm not defenseless
Wide receiver catching Hail Mary's I'm Christian
5 and out hydraul yes we stick shift
Coming with the quick hits, fast with instincts
Cornerbacks, safeties, I burn 'em like incense
On the field I'm daddy and the ball is my infant
I don't need too much support but I'm in love with the pigskin
All I really know how to do is win
Super bowl champ, Disney World, let the kids in
Hall of fame Wayne, I'm putting my dibs in
Catch me in the game on fourth and inches
Chorus:
I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em
I don't, I don't talk to them boys that sat on them benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
Put me in the game on fourth and inches
Coach put me in the game on fourth and inches
And I'ma leave them boys at the line of scrimmage
Verse 2:
Uhh I am a New Orleans Saint, and to the Houston Texans I'd like to say thanks

Super dome it's going down it's high time boys

'Cause if I hit you you gone have to strap yo chin on
See the score on the goal line, it's on
Fourth and inches let the crowd catch this song
Chorus:
I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em, I don't talk to 'em
I don't, I don't talk to them boys that sat on them benches
I was in the game on fourth and inches

I tell her, get your money girl and just start breathing
Cuz if it ain't about the dough, it ain't about me neither
See a gangster like myself I get that paper on women
Man yo women probably out there with some paper to give me
Listen, you're looking at a real pimp ask my old women
And they tell you no remote, I control women

And if you smile at my girl I'll make her smile back

Damn, burning buildings, flamed up
They couldn't take da heat so they jumped
Man, they want to want to transform the streets we grew up on
A deck of cards with no aces: luck gone
Uhh, tower 1 fell, tower 2 fell
Now everybody screwed like loose nails
I'm like what are we to do with a house with no roof
Look up and pray to whose above you
God, yeeup, now just look in your seat

Try to keep our head up, and not get fed up 
But it seems like they won't let us live
Yea, and I was told that life ain't shit and this world ain't neither
This is why I scream fuck the world not the people 
Yes, but in the belly of the beast
People get swallowed like meat, eat
And your president was lying while my people was dying
In the helicopter flying looking down reading signs
Help! SOS, somebody save us
Ten dead inside, where our savior
And, I've seen tragedy I've looked it in the eye
Hate being at my lowest so I choose to get high
High, so high, that my name should be sky
It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's I
Yea, I holla five on four till they bury me man

Take care of Jew Jew and his mom 
Take care of little Jah 
Take care all the kids 
'Cause through us they live
Yeah, lord please keep your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul you keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just want to be free
Free, they said they knew there was a problem with the levees, and they did nothing 
Clinton approved the money, and Bush did nothing 
So, Katrina hit, and three days later, Fema just comin'
I'm feeling like what the hell is really goin' on
Planes into buildings, what's next King Kong?
I wish we didn't even have a reason for this song  Moment of silence for the people that's gone 
To those restin' in peace, those dead and deceased, soon again we meet 
Or 'til I'm high and drunk and my car swerves off road, haa
I'll meet you at the crossroads
Lord, please keep your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul you keep
And i don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just wanna be free

And said the next dick she take would be her husband's dick, damn
See, I had the steak
She had the lobster
I say, "I want you on my team"
She say, "I don't join rosters"
Oh, believe dat
And then the drinks came
And then the mood changed
And then her answer switched
She let her hair down
And lit a cancer stick
She saw it turn me off
And said she tryna quit
She went to the ladies room
And I hopped on my phone
Most likely she doin' the same thing
Like, "Girl, what you think?
Um, should I do it?"
She say, "Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it"
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said, "That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga

And see, I had the shrimp, she had the pasta
She say she don't like rappers, we got something in common
I said, "Especially that nigga Wayne"
We both laughed and then the wine came
And then her mind changed
She loosened up her blouse, her smirks turn to smiles
It was a full moon when she turned around
She used my restroom, she say, "You know, girl stuff"
She left the water runnin' and hit her girl up
Like, "What you think?" 
"Should I do it?"
She say, "Shit, I don't know
You know these niggas, he probably used to it"
Her other friend grabbed the phone and said, "That bitch just hatin', you better fuck that nigga

We fell asleep naked
So when we woke up, she wanted that morning dick 
I had the grits, she had the waffles
She say she drank too much last night, and I should have stopped her
I say, "Believe that"
And then my phone rang
She saw my girl name
And then her world changed
She put her clothes on and said, "I'm going home, Wayne"
I said, "Lisa, chill"
And that was the wrong name
She hit her girl up and said, "I hate rappers"
And then her girl laughed and said, "Bitch, what happened?"
And she said, "What you think?
Fuck, why did I do it?
Bitch, I bet that nigga knew he was gon' fuck from 'Hi, how you doing"
And then her friend on the phone say, "Girl, I was just trippin', I would have fucked that nigga

And then she said, "Yes, I did, and I fucked him good
So I hope he tell his girl that I fucked him good"I love you, I hate you and that's why I love her
Nasty by nature, a natural woman
Graphic but graceful, but sassy, but humble
That cat and that face and that ass and them bubbles
She rattle my snake but I bury my shovel
I carry my weight and went tatted my muscle
She act like she’s brazy, I act like I'm dumbo
It's all rice and gravy, it’s all bread and butter 
And sometimes you remind me of my ex
And sometimes you remind me why I left
And sometimes I call you my queen and I watch the throne
Sometimes you call and I just watch the phone, I don't know
That's why I wonder, I wonder how many stars you done seen
While we fucking, while we fucking, yeah
I wonder how many calls you done screened
While we fucking and didn't say nothing
I don't know whether to love you or fuck you
Love you or fuck you, love you or fuck you
Girl, I don't know whether to love you or fuck you
Kiss you or cuss you, trick you or trust you
Girl, I don't know, I don't know, look
I’ve been here, I’ve been waiting on you, yeah
Waiting on you,  on you yeah
See what time it is, time to make your move, ooh
You should have your phone unlocked if you really love me
Throw that bitch a block if she was really nothing
Would I go through your phone locked?
So now I'm deep in my emotions
’Cause I saw her shoot her shot, and you replied with some emojis
I don't need a friendly motherfucker for a boyfriend
Who forget about me when he's drinking with the broskis
I just want a family man, RIP Kobe

Where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like...
Yeah, I'm like
As soon as I come home, I was workin long
She wanna know what I was working on
So I play her this song
And I make her feel wrong
But still in all in my eyesight, she passed right
I can't trip cuz no one loves the fast life
Or sittin in the passenger seat, hold tight
When she gives a whole platter to me, her whole life
But for me that's too much to eat, in one bite but
I'mma chew and just do what I gotta
Other bitches get the boot like a high top Prada
Where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like...
Can I talk to her, yeah, um
Leave the drama on daytime television
What is this detention?
It feel like elementary
I wish I never injure
Hurt or scar you
When I think of my future
Baby that are you
I mean that is you
Part of my fears
You know, part of my mental
See what I'm into?
See how I'm in too deep in the shit too?
It ain't just you, it is us two
I trust you, you gotta trust me
Cuz in them other bitches eyes I'm a must-see
Now where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me girl
It's killin me
Wooooo
I must like it when you question me about it baby
I swear, but they say, it's just not trueLadies and gentlemen
This one goes out to that little kid that got fried Spam for lunch

And this one right here is for that ghetto girl with the bad perm
That just burn baby, burn baby, burn
Pop open a malt liquor
Smoke something until your scalp gets killed
Gangstas and pimps
Love lobsters and shrimps
Kool-Aid and chicken
Flashy things and women

For his and hers

Wet zipper

'Cause moms say quit the sizzurp
But my auntie mom trippin', she a tripper
And I can eat you quicker

Weezy bitch, yuh yuh, weezyLook look look - don't play with me
Look look look
Huh? Huh? Look
Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust bang!
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get it - it's Weezy Wee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'mma hit the block and borrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run
What is this that done got me in your district? Twist it
Now everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians
I'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people
Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people
Seventeen Creeper is who I - what I - be, dog
The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five
In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog
On four tires, or feet, dog
I still be on the block sweepin'
Nobody is not sleepin'
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff
Cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump
And passin' a blunt - me circle once to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead
But, dog, you get it raw if you war with the kid
I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge
Huh?!
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run
You might catch me with bandanas and strapped T
On the back street of your block in the back seat
I'mma cap three at the first coward I up and see
I'mma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet
When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday
Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed added up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip
I know you see me: Little Weezy kill 'em all easy
A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy
You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes
Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun

I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weakNow a Queen, once a Princess
Let's make a Princess
And you know time is money, time to invest
Talkin’ shit to her, without bad breath
Told her "I could take you there without MapQuest"
Thinking "Should I fall back, or forward progress?"
You know love is hard to swallow, and digest
Pause
She gon' have to take my love from me
But if I fall for her, you could call me clumsy
If I hit it and crash, I'm a crash dummy
I might just eat her up, I got an empty stomach
And you know drinking is bad, on an empty stomach
So we both get drunk, and just eat each other
We in the bedroom, I guess it’s one of those
I think you overdressed, in your underclothes
I confess to you, give my best to you
I told my last name, I'm tryna give an S to you
I think you a beast, without a leash
You could ride me, baby, like I'm the streets
I got a black eye, from your heartbeat
Make me change my lifestyle, call Robin Leach

I'm ready, 
To love you 
Forever 
Hey love now

Puffin, chillin' on some shit that make us touch the ceilin’

Million dollar questionI just bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech
Got too much on my mind hit the blunt and reflect
When I was under arrest my bitch was under the rest
I bet she fucked while I was gone, then I double the bet
I smoke weed in Amsterdam, and I smuggle the rest
I act like I'm shaking your hand and you get punched with the left
And you can get killed for shit you said under your breath
And if you do choose to bark, it ain't none to a vet
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Yo bitch about to swallow a bunch of me's, nigga
I got a white girl fucking, sucking me, nigga
While I'm thinkin' 'bout the days that it sucked to be niggas
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech
Nigga, keep your head up like that gun in ya neck
And my bitch was scared to fly 'till we fucked on a jet
Fucked her in the cockpit, all these buttons to press
I just got myself a blonde with the puffiest chest
I just bought myself some time, rolled my Rollie a check
Ridin' in a double R, just Regretting Regret
Getting loaded more than once, no Russian Roulette
I just left King of Diamonds, I just fucked a baguette
I ain't called her since that day, I just wasn't impressed
Move with a nose ring, startin' a bunch of BS
Hide the gun, knock on yo door, dressed like UPS
Man, fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggas
I'm a bear coughing up a bunch of honeybees, nigga
Got hoes under me, like a submarine, nigga
Got a bitch with a clit like a butter bean, nigga 
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech 
Bought my sons toys and my daughter a pet
Bought my homeboys choppers and my woman a dress
And to catch me if I fall, I bought my mother a net
Let's go
Anyone could get knocked off
Any bitch could get knocked up
Baby daddy get locked up
Sell everything, put the house up
Don't say anything, keep your mouth shut
Except two words and that's "How much?"
If I do get out, we're skipping time
She said what about her mama
I paused
I said "I gotta do what I gotta
Is you gon' ride with me or you not"
And she start cryin' and said "I'm not"
And I paused
I said "It's probably what's best
Well, I'll be back when pigs fly
So they can follow on my jet"
I tell my pilot where to go next
I bring that problem to your doorstep
I catch you slippin' while you tired
Like the road wet
Like it's no sweat
I'm Tunechi, hi, I'm here to collect
They wondering why I ain't getting no rest
'Cause that's just too close to arresting
And to far from certain protects
Oh, Police, read me my wrongs
Or just leave me alone
Rubbing, squinting my eyes
I still don't see where I'm wrong
Sold my soul to the streets
They bought it previously-owned
Went to jail for a Glock
And soon as I got home
I went and bought myself a 9 and that new MAC 11
You talk shit at 10:59 and make the news at 11:00
Bitch, I'm the wildest motherfucker on a team full of rebels
Young, wild motherfucker to a MILF, cougar, leopard
I'm a lion, motherfucker, to these hoes 'cause you can sweat a little
Euro my secret weapon like Mark, Jackson and Stephen
I see plain clothes pigs and unmarking trappers
My bitch believe what I say
I told her "Salt, what's pepper"
I'm cold as malts and metals
Sell stolen parts
Whatever
Put three holes in your head like a bowling ball
Don't spare 'em
And all my niggas in jail
That's bullshit, I smell ya
Remember Destiny's Child
My favorite one was Farrah
Man
Bought myself a 9 and my brother a Tech
I know you don't want war like you just a cadet
Tell a motherfucker who next
"Motherfucker, you next"
I'm the best
Rapper alive and they love me to death
Bye
Yeah
Fuck these niggas, I ain't stuntin' these niggasYeah
Suffix, people
Chyeah
You know
You, you, you already
Yeah
C'mon
Kicking rocks on the block, telling all the OGs
"I be coming for your spot when you're not looking"
Hot cooking, mama got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when them good grades came through
Then the cooked Ks came through
Some soft, some stepped-on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights
Thought I heard niggas coming, thought I saw the cop lights, but
I was dreaming, then I woke
The junkies was still fiending, and I had coke so
I had hope; you may say that its wrong
But I ain't talking to your child, I'm talking to this song
I'm just doing a buck down memory lane
If I crash, just pick up my brain
And yes, my niggas the same, but they quicker to bang
And if they do, then I'm the nigga you blame
So I shoot first anyway, and I would do the honors any day
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the stage like I whip through the yay
Show your ass how to take four and get eight
And it don't take four niggas to get straight
The only Hot Boy eating off this plate: Young
Weezy baby, that's what ya bitch say
Give her ass a location and a template
Show her how to work the interstate
Stop working with that thinner weight, get your brakes fixed
Stop playing, 'cause all we know is gunplay
Trip while you full and my clip gon' be empty
When the stomachs get empty, anything's tempting
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kids' sake
Hurricane wiped us out like a earthquake
We tryna save face, but we ain't got a place
To stay, so they made us evacuate
We on our way, pussies, relocate
Y'all know us, when you see us, put your jewels up
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up
It's that serious, homie, pick the news up
It wasn't good, nigga, think about the hood, nigga
The people who ain't never had shit, ain't gon' never have shit
Bullshit, 'cause they still gon' try to manage
Niggas doing anything, like, God gon' understand 'em
But please understand this: niggas with money lost mansions
Niggas with nothing lost families, lives lost in traffic
Water up to the attic, there goes the stashes
But a nigga got passion
Even though the bounce-back seeming like magic
Shit... Well, call me Siegfried
Watch how I turn one key to a hundred Gs
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze:
Summer, please, know I live for you
Throw on the wife-beater, let back the lid for you
A few years I probably hear from you, but now I'm here for you
I know niggas that shed a tear for you
Behind bars, tryna get to you, and probably never see you
This that real talk if ya ever heard it, homie
Shit hurts so much, might have to hurt you, homie
No commercial, no fronting, no curve on it
No cut; tell life, "So what?"
The drought's here; not only white's slowed up
The weed's slowed up, we can't even roll up
Fuck it, put a dent in the money too
But that's the last thing 'cause hustle is what we do
Hustle with what? How we getting on?
Where he sitting at? What he sitting on?
Stand up if you know it's true
The end of the world coming, and my city the proof, damn
Shit... And this is after disaster
This ain't rap, this a recap
Stepping off the G4, still strapped
Bust ya head in the air, that's a skycap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off, 'cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon' eat
Then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reaching
And I'ma get there through these bars, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
When everything pause, I'm proceeding
I'm a leader, meet the son of Jacida
Fuck the world, not the people, damn!No one on the corner have swagger like us

Like I'm on stage bitch, married to the money 
I just skipped the engagement
I'm fly, my ally is the bird game
The top flew off of my whip, bird brains
Third lane in the back of the first lane
I need Rihanna's "Umbrella" for this purple rain
Earth to wayne, call it Wayne's World
Money money, call 'em Wayne's girls
Young money gangstas
Runnin this shit like a flanker

The air got polluted when I had the Maserati 
But now I'm gettin green, I'm thinkin higher than Ferrari 
You should call me god body 
Fresh to def to the arm legga legga 
All white Nikes, check the bomb was venetta

Threw on a scarf, look with a different Louie

In Tom Ford linen and a crispy fedora
Caught throwin a tilt
Thought I was the man 'til I puff the open sex, her ass dropped on the silk
The nocturnal hustla, product of the evening
Gritty, runnin through New York City like the thieving
Time to up the ante
Pockets uncanny
Bulging Kim pussy pressed against the panty
Now I'm in Vermont, and done funny in Miami
Duckin rat packs like Sinatra and Sammy

What up?
So, y'know, I was thinkin', right?
Y'know, since we doin' the "He Rap He Sang" album, I figured
Y'know that you from N-O, right?
Mhm, mhm
Right, right, and I'm from Florida
Tallahassee
Right, so I got a couple things to, like, teach you
Okay
That you probably need to know about
Since you came to Miami now
I did
And you know what I'm sayin'
You pretty much a certified Florida boy
Woo!
So is it cool if, like, I just teach you a couple things you need to know?
It's not much, all you gotta do is sit back, relax, take it in, you ready?
No worries, no homo
Alright, let's go
Heavy Chevys, heavy, heavy Chevys, man 
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man? 
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
Yeah, I like this, a'ight big bruh, fall it out
Big, big paper, we ain't fuckin' with no petty change
Heavy Chevys, heavy, heavy Chevys, man
I see you, I think I got this one, I think I got it
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man?
Y'know, I was taught by like, Trick Daddy
And y'know, the real Dunk Ryders
Heavy Chevys , heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
Let's see what I got 
Big, big paper, we ain't fuckin' with no petty change
So let's start with the
'72 Chevelle, I know that well
'Cause everybody try to buy that bitch from me
But I will never sell, hell
Mids and highs and 4-12s
24 inches, chopped seats, complete with the Pirells, yeah
Inside got baby blue 'gator scales
Even on the bottom of the seat, you can see the 'gator tail
My shit hard as a turtle shell
Plus I got a mothafuckin' motor that'll make them tires yell
When I was 11, dawg, I learned 'bout my Chevy, dawg
I burned the Pirellis off, convertible, take it off
Believe my leather stayin' soft
That's why I'm at the start line, 'bout to take it off
Heavy Chevys, heavy, heavy Chevys, man
A'ight, see?  You gotta learn, big bruh 
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man?
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
Now, I kinda want you to come back and tell me what you learned from my lesson  Y'know what I'm sayin'?
Big, big paper, we ain't fuckin' with no petty change
Mhm, I'ma finish hittin' the weed first
Heavy Chevys, heavy, heavy Chevys, man
Right, right 
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man?
Oh, but of course, but of course
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
But still, I need to know that you know that I know that you know 
Big, big paper, we ain't fuckin' with no petty change
Let me get somethin'
Well, I went and got that new Chevy truck, the one without the little man step
And I love that bitch so much, tomorrow I'ma wear the fan belt
Speakers in the bed sound like I got band help
Beatin' down yo' block, leave you with a damn welt
I used to have a '64 a few years ago
I had that bitch on three wheels on one of my old videos
Now I got a honey SS, I call it Cheerio
But my neighbors call it, "Please turn down the stereo!"
Now cut that hoe up louder
24 karat gold pipes on the low Impala
See Pain, I knew a lil' somethin', but thanks for the lesson
As a matter of fact, y'know what? I'ma buy you a Chevy
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man?
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
See, see Pain I ain't gon' lie, when I got to Florida
Big, big paper, we ain't fuckin' with no petty change
I haven't saw that many Chevys in my life
Heavy Chevys, heavy, heavy Chevys, man
I meant to say "seen," but um
Why are these streets nothin' but heavy Chevys, man?
In the spirit of Chevys
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
I'ma switch to T-Wayne and take it back
I said, a long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance, I could make the people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
Oh, but February made me shiver with every paper I deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride
But somethin' touched me deep inside the day the music died
So bye-bye Ms. American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys was drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die, day that I dieI be like why not?
My nigga Khaled in here with me
I fucks with my homie
TS
Young boy call me Weezy F Baby
Got a whole lot of money, and a bunch of ways to make it
I'mma country ass nigga got diamonds in my teeth ho
Chopper that I'm toting make me feel like Deebo
Rock a nigga boat then speed off on the speedboat
Take a nigga ho and skeet all in her speedo's
Take a nigga ho and show her how to break a kilo
Show the bitch how to turn a bird into a beetle
Weezle F. Baby, no cliche
Just money, hard dick, no foreplay
Standing in the court way, fuck what the court say
There's money on the corner baby, welcome to my workplace
Sippin' with my drink laced, you know how I get down
I promise baby I'mma fall asleep if I sit down
Uptown his town, Hollygrove hizzound
Fuck with the little man, you will never get found

Behind mine, I'll do 10 in the box nigga
My neck of the woods is Uptown ask for me
Young Maine, Young Money, Cash Money, Fast Money
Had the fiends hittin' the wall thinkin' that they crash dummies
While you little petty hustlers struggling for gas money
I'm on a full tank, bitch I'm bout me
You'll probably catch me and Weezy Baby on South Beach
In back of the Phantom the TVs playing
The game about to start, some bitch singing the National Anthem 
Whether it's the streets or the CDs, y'all gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me
If you lookin' for me I be with your bitch nigga
Ho I done fucked and she done sucked my dick 
If it ain't 'bout dollars , then I can't holler 
And everybody know the Birdman the king
And he love his son Wayne so he give me everything
And that's the logics nigga watch it
Keep my name up outta that nigga gossip
Money gon' drain like a brand new faucet
Aren't you conscious? alert for the coppers
They give us the work then throw us in jail
Don't smile for the cameras gotta know when to sail
I'm blowin' an L, low in the 12

Ho I'm so fuckin' fly, my eyes are aviaters
I'm stuck at the top floor in the elevater
Cause I'm high, dumb high

Young guy, but rich though
And I keep a rag on me like a 64, like a 64

Lord wake me up to holy water on my face and 3 blood drops dried on the side of my eyes
Why we gotta kill our own kind when we rise
Got me looking down the ladder now when I climb
Pulling up on my nephews
And they don't wanna drive
They wanna learn how to work the tool
And who am I not to do the duty
Just think if pops advice get sent from black ink
And that stinks but homie that's real
And in the hood even steaks smell bad on the grill

Bitch the money home, I know you ain't gon' stay once the money gone
So while I'm rich I pull my dick and get my fuckin' on
Youngin' on some real "Gangsta Gangsta" shit
Blame it on the neighborhood I was sanctioned in
But I'mma make sure we get them acres
Tell 'em fuck computers, we good with paper
Tell 'em fuck the world cause I'm hood by nature
Feelin' that way is how the hood'll make ya
The hood is vacant, the streets are empty, yeah
Mr. Bush, rebuild the city, but
Yeah, over like yesterday floatin' to the floodgates
This is New Orleans, welcome to the blood state
A blood bath, and you ain't nothin' but tub bait
No political justice not even the judge safe
If his ass can't swim he get a closed case
We need our own space, I ain't talkin' about Jupiter
No luck, no help and we the fuckin' future
I'm a hoosier, usually the cool one
But when I need it, I turn into a looter
God forgive, but do he forgive the brutal
Even when it's for the better of your junior
Soon you see that life's just another movie
And the main character dies at the end, usually
There's nothin' that haven't been done that you can do to me
I been hit, I been shot nigga shoot at me!
Yeah, money on the mind, murder in the plans
Disturbin' if you may, but it's dinner for the fam
Hustler by law, support when I can
Hustle when I can, tell me nothing I'm a man
Smell my shit as I walk off the stand
Nuts to my feet with my heart in my hand
Pardon my G, but I'm one of a kind
Been shot two times, here to put it in a rhyme
Slow lane, move the Coupe like a 5
If I get pulled over, bitch I'm gon' do time
And I know my niggas love me, but they can't do mine
So I gotta be smart, get bread or get behind
Get lost or get in line
But the carpet's still fine
So keep tryin', the whole world turnin' back
But we keep tryin' until we get our piece, no piece
Keep Firin'
BahFuck that nigga—pussy-ass nigga

Sit him in the trunk, tell him, "Let's have fun"
No noise fat potato on the end of the gun
My boy’s get that paper just as quick as it come
And if you're standing in the way then mama missing her son
I remember back in the day it was me and Brandon
Cut school, smoke weed, I was strapped, he had one too
Rest in peace from the Hollygrove crew

Nigga own mother told me the bitch loves to hustle
Gotta get that paper baby, gotta get that cake
Cop a black Lamborghini, put gold on the plates
Home to the beach, sand at my feet
R1 one wheel hanging off the seat
My nigga Lil Naughty was a downtown G
We use to blow 2 or 3, tell me all about the streets
My nigga Soulja Slim had a motherfuckin message
Magnolia head busta, Uptown legend
Lil Naughty we use to get red eye
I can't believe my nigga dead ah
Lil Soulja he meant what he said, ah
I can't believe that nigga dead, ah
My nigga Lil Spitta that's my nigga all day
First bullet out the barrel nigga better guard your face
Say my nigga Lil Spitta he in the game let's play
He about to take over for my half time break
Now once upon a time not long ago
He was in the hospital and damn near broke
And all he had was a mask and a Glock
A box of baking soda and a couple of pots
The streets was empty, the fiends was hungry
He wanted to give em just what they wanted
To get cheap coke all he needed was connect
So he called his homie Wayne from the Hollygrove set
Yes, then I got his call, I'll be on the way

As soon as I flew by in that navy and baby blue six
She beeped and left a message that she come up with a solution
I scootin a run through straight to my house I won't be foolish
She had no bathin suit and then want me to see her booty
I oozed it in her coochie when she got in my Jacuzzi
She asked me for a kiss ah

Rated hood bitch, Bitch I'm hood bitch

Blood gang sworm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile
Like my grill didn't cost me a 100 thou
Put my money, money where my mouth is
Naw, I don't fuck around, stay on my J.O.-
Hov' been about that dough since I was a day old
Oh, push perico if I need to for the Root of Evil
Was born in the belly: that's the way the streets breed you
One life to live - notice you get no sequel
So I truly got to live this like my last movie
6 oohie, jewels dripping, big tooly
I ball for real: y'all niggas is Sam Bowie
And with the third pick, I made the earth sick
M.J., him Jay, fade-away, perfect

Every crime-nigga that rhyme or touch a mic
Because my mind's quicker
I'm a '88er, 9-6 to "Reasonable Doubt"

Exspensive car keys and glasses, t-shirts, pants's

 Fuck 'em
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go
X2
 You can't doubt what I got, and if you do you can't go where I go
I'ma go by myself, I come in by myself, so I guess it's all about me and it's fuck you
Come on home biscuit,for man's sake
No more fake hugs and handshakes
Stand straight, you sweeter than a pancake
Me, I'm trying to get that green like the landscape
As for my team, originate
See what I gotta say can't wait
I demand cake
Gotta eat, keep the family straight
They all holding out they hands and plates
Yeah, Wayne's from a place called Hollygrove from the bottom of the globe
Area code 5-0-4
Be hero Joe and I zero in with the Eagle and there'll be no him
I don't need no help, I don't need no homie
I don't need nobody - nigga, I got money
Nigga, I got heart to go along with the guns
Call me Weezy F. Baby, I be by myself when I cum, yeah
I don't need 'em, I don't need 'em
I don't love 'em, I don't trust 'em
So mothafucka I was born by myself with my dick in my hand
With my mind on a million dollar plan
Now baby, you are looking at the million dollar man
And I'ma die alone, so alone I stand
Dudes that never spoke to me now wanna speak 
Girls that never said a word now wanna creep 
Guys that never ran with me now wanna be 
The only passenger in my coupe with two seats
Damn, what is it Holmes? Ya boy's breath soft
Air fake, I can feel the silicone
You're all a bunch of Pamela Andersons
Me, a family man, I take care of the family, man 
And it seems like my day one niggas ain't acting like day one niggas
I ain't changed, I just came up, niggas
And trust me when I say I ain't put the streets down or them things up, nigga
Bring the Phantom through the hood, I ain't fronting on y'all
Just tryna let you know it's bigger than the corner, my dog
I ain't playing basketball, but I'm ballin' for sure
Now back to the money, catch me when I come off tour 
The rims may offend you on the shit I slide into
Fuck you, send ya to the desert, tell ya be cool
Ahem, hold on the pistols
Roll by the cops and turn up the stereo
Sittin' at the corner, lookin' like a owner
Talkin' to the owner, yeah my price goin' up
All in the strip club, never get a boner
Only get hard for dough, I'm Homer
And you're a Simpson, and I'm a pimp, son
And she ain't comin' to the crib 'til her friend come
We gettin' money over here, you need to get some
Out comes the cold steel for my income
Out comes the cold steel for my victims
Born alone, die alone, but you could die with them
Cars white and sexy like Nicole Kidman
Bad chick by my side, video vixen
Ya might fly to L.A. just to shop at Kitson
Thousand dollar hoodies, I'm pickin' up about fifteen
That's about fifteen thousand, I'm trickin'
Zero on bitches 
Swarovski crystals, Great China Wall
And my money run longer than the Great China Wall
And my pockets is Mediterranean Sea deep
So keep plotting and praying to get me Dawg you gotta feel me on this one
What it be like dawg? I'm on some, some adult grown up type shit
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Jeezy, Juvie, Turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg
Age is nothing but some digits, nigga trust me on this
Cause I think I speak for everyone when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L in the C L, gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every whip cause haters likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip
She end up catching rights to her lip behind diapers and shit
But I like me a spliff drink henny without the ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinking I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm able to handle my situations correctly
And I know I might be young but nigga gone definitely respect me
But in the mean while I'm fighting gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like I'm never happy now
Except for the fact my daughter saying I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up, but I smoke bout 3 blunts
And puff a cooler boost me up
And say a prayer for everyday
Just so I get through the stuff, but I be like
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm fed up thinking everything's a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff, just trust me it's tough
But I maintain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when things get awful
And I'm often on the edge stuck without a solution
Someway I still pick it out and shuffle out the confusion
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and just doubt me
Cause y'all cats don't really know me, y'all just know about me
But my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watching and my mothers the dearest
And I ain't never say I thought they ain't appreciate what I do
But just know if I wasn't a man we wouldn't make it through, but I be like
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Who would have known that this was someday turn out so hectic?
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
And I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with it at all so I don't say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully changed
I'm always street so I'll forever be facing a change
And I'll keep the slang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm wasting a man
And if I want it, then I get, and if I need it, I have it
Take care of them family first, plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And ever so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leading my path
And I ain't ask for you to like me, I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me, no other man can never make me or break me
Now I be faithfully inspired by the hood til I'm gone
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown so I'll be good on my own, but I be like
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

Or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
Stormin' through the house, screamin', "Where's this bastard's crack?!!"
I flash the mack in front of your gal and make her tell
Like, "Slut! Where's the yay, or I'mma pop one in your grill!"
It's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas

Nasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place
Mask the face, automatic attach to waist
You bastards play? Then it get awful and bad
There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head
And they gon' either get it right, or they get it at night
And when they spit, it lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice
Henny and ice is what I prefer, but light on the rocks
I pack them clips tight on them Glocks and light up your block
And if there's coke involved, then your throat's involved
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all
Me and my nigga, Super Sosa, run up in your crib
While your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her
If you wan' grudge, chances slim like Ethiopia
If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia
Recognize it's real and nothing other than that
Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em cause it get deep with 'em

Who wan' beef with a nigga? Creep with a nigga?
When it comes down to guns, look, I sleep with them triggasMe and the twin ninas have menage ??
Pistol on my side, don't come at me sideways
When the 5 sprays, he paralyzed 
Bust til' the Glock hot enough to cook fried eggs
Most niggas my age been stopped liking rap
When they found out them niggas rappin, ain't write them raps
And they ghost writer ain't write it, that nigga typed them raps
In his phone, text it to holmes and he recite them raps
But on any type of track, I go dummy on it
The game dumbin down cause a bunch of dummies doin it
My weed got somethin' funny on it..
It make you feel a lil weezy, so they spendin cash money on it
You see me baby out here chasin the check
But you can go from makin connects to makin collects
If you rappin,  hear me rap it..  it can make you depressed
Cause you tryna be street that don't make you the best
It's some shit holmes said I can't wait to address
I'm the greatest I should ghostwrite for Drake and Em next
I'm so nice I can make them upset, but I dont give a hell
Louder guns, longer clips, bigger shells
So the hole big as hell when I smoke shit
Ha, me if I let the tommy hit you, you a ghost bitch
I did my own remix cause this dope Swizz
I roast this, I can't wait to post this..... BARS

As soon as we get out the rain we se a storm
And you went throughout my veins in every arm. So even throughout the pain im very calm

Ima mother fuckin cashmoney millionareTurn the music up
Uh, them hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don’t let it blow up in your face slime
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a motherfuckin' K9
We murk niggas in the day time when the birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'
Everybody got automatics like cockin' back is too time-consumin'
Bought my bitch her own business so she can stay the fuck out mine
But she know hoes, hoes ain’t nothin' but hoes, ain’t good for nothin' but a house fire
Got a .9 right by her panty line, she’ll blow you away like a dandelion
And before they cross me, they’ll nail me to it
And I'ma dance when it's hammer time
My insides fucked up, and it feels so good to be vandalized
And these bars is handlebars, 'cause when I spit, I handle mine
God made dirt and dirt don’t hurt, that’s a lie
Cause I come from that dirty-dirty, and I know pain like raps and rhymes, my nigga
Doing big things, big wings, dragonflies
If I don’t live to see tomorrow, all my kids got daddy's eyes
I hustle, hustle like the rent was due yesterday
Muscle car got more muscles than a heavyweight
Take these bitches breath away, resuscitate
And the weed I smoke is strong as pepper spray, that strong
Pussy walls I interior decorate
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
Put in over time, that’s why I get paid the big check
Tote a .45 'cause they ain’t make the .46 yet
Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer
Fuck around and you can get shot up, like a low angle
Old ass money, I been ballin’ my nigga
And I been stop wearing Versace
'Cause I was wearing Versace when Pac was wearin' Versace
Uh, real niggas say, "Woo woo"
And such and such kill such and such
The streets talkin', bullshit walks on crutches but it strut the strut
Niggas panic, button pressin', the end is coming, count your blessings
We livin' in the day and time, where the Ten Commandments are now suggestions
How depressin', how unpleasant, click-clack, pow intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses with tight pussies, I found the crevice
High socks, and tie-dye shirts
My fashion statement is a run-on sentence
Pussy niggas still making me sick
Kill all them niggas, no more symptoms
I’m smokin' weed in my tool shack
I'm gettin' twisted like Allen wrenches
Bitch, come dance with the devil nigga like ballerinas in catechism
Got a AK with a shell-catcher
And I'll pistol whip ya 'til your head swell up
No Xanax, just coke and Henny
I had to kick that shit like 4/20
And I hit yo' ass with the SIG Sauer 
Had them put you back together like a jigsaw
And I'ma still bring that bacon home
I don't really give a fuck what the pigs thought
A pussy-ass rat, that's Tom and Jerry 
I was gettin' fat off of commissary 
And rest in peace to my nigga Soupy 
I've been goin' in since Slime was buried 
And in jail, them snacks like bags of money
Just imagine what I had before a bag of cookies
A new deck of cards and a bag of coffee
Get you poked up dead in the shower, bloody
It's fucked up but it's safe to say
For the last seven months, I felt right at home 
And with the same pen that they stabbed you with
I'll wash that bitch off and go write a poem 
Niggas sleepin' on me, had to shoot one time just to see who'd wake
I don't see your fate but I can see you fake
I gotta light my grass just to see you snakes
Bitch, life is a gamble
Pay up what you owe boy
No drive-bys like they did Ricky
I'm hoppin' out like Doe Boy
Hustle like the rent was due yesterday
Muscle car got more muscles than a heavyweight
On the edge, just one step away so step away
And the weed I smoke is strong as pepper spray, that strong
Pussy walls I interior decorate
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
Put it over time, that’s why I get paid that big check
Tote a .45 'cause they ain’t make a .46 yet
Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
I got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah
Got all my niggas with me, that’s a no brainer, yeah

Ho this ain't punch, I'm sippin' on some syzurp
I roll a fat joint and do my fingers like scissors
The game so cold, I done had my share of blizzards
And now I got that big money running like rivers
Nigga, I'm here to get my shit straight
Burner on the hip waist
Leave a nigga street full of bones like a fish plate 
Yeah I'm from the hood, but now I'm living in a rich way
That's why I got on my knees and thank God for this day
So say watchu wanna say, I need to throw a cup of water in my face
First place INigga. I'm from a city full of pity these niggas are silly
Kill you in Harlem hit the turnpike in lower Philly
And these little niggas ain't got books in their book bags
Your next neighborhood killer might be who you look past
Get it right before you get left
And sent to the upper room cause your ass couldn't calm down
Rewind me back and you notice I'm trying to warn you
Before your collarbone be what hollows are getting torn through
Play gangasta tonight and you won't see the morn' dew
And the whole next month would be something mother mourn through
God forgive me I know Thou shalt not kill
But id rather him than Millz so if I gotta I will
I'm from New Orlean where the water never clean
So ima gonna shower in some fuckin gasoline
You fuckin with the monster everyday is Halloween
My choppers ain't no doctors but they taking out your spleen
No my riders ain't no robbers but they taking everything
From Mamas to baby Mamas to Papas and we goin to pop up with poppers and leg warmers, barrel way down my jeans
My nigga ain't no fire but I'm a blaze everything
I'm that hollygrove roster and my number 17
Eastside bitch, thats where I come up as a teen
But now I'm the man, and now I'm the man
And this is my land Lilweezyana and New Orleans In the City
H-Town sunnyside this my playground
Home of ... candy paint 808 sound
Styrofoam here it is If you make my syrup spill
Ima put my hands on you like a steering wheel
And we dont feel to kill cause this the pace to cop the work
The cop's a jerk got it so hot its comin out my shirt
You get your mama merked, You know the Glocks will squirt
Cause niggas going out the shrooms and those hoes will pop the purse
Houston Texas who harder than us
With a hundred thousand flipped dope boys get a rush
Hunch of codine and we pour it in the cup, now everybody slower than the short yellow bus
Now everybody know that the boy is the truth
Stay down I team next door to the booth

High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brains
But watch them hoes that want the change, it's not a game
Or a short cuban ho, with a fat ass though

Hold up, wait a minute, chill out, stop

Bad bitch in mi casa

Tunchi bitch on my Future shit

I wake up cranky turn into a lunatic
Then shoot my bitch and buy orange juice and grits
Oozie clip I need another oozie clip
I shoot to kill these pussy niggas shooting bricks
I'm too for real your head just a souvenir
She want to get it off her chest but her boobs too big
I'm bumping Carter V on an Ipod
My bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet
She said "soon as these niggas hear your new shit they gon' have to give their styles back"
I say "you too crazy" she said "you too humble"
I say "you too baby" she said "you too sweet"
Then I ask do she go both ways
She said "they do say love is a two way street"
I say ooh
Talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty talk dirty to me
Treat that girl like cuisine she gon' want to shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum I gon' die on my feet
Never knees in the dirt never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
I sell birds to the bees I sell birds to the trees
"Tune I heard you don't sleep" I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk but I tweak for that purp for that pink
Ya you see what I'm saying like you heard what I see
I'm a verbal disease I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets since my curtains were sheets
Chefs on these beats I'm just stiring the grease
That bitch you in love when she working for me
I personally get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers I'm at peace
Word I smirk when I squeeze
Trigger smart street smart I'm a nerd I'm a geek
I'm absurd I'm unique
Did my time at Cash Money time served and release
But this agent ain't free word
That's just word on these streets
But that shit is old news that shit yester-week
I'm just focused, focused on my expertise
They like "Tunechi you good" I'm like Bob yes sire
Don't, I mean don't, don't question me let me breath
Dawg, big dawg, I cock back and shoot at your fleas
Money long tree trunk, now stand under me catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees but repeat what you heard you a dead parakeet
This Tunechi bitch your bitch Tunechi's bitch
I fuck her on the balcony we watch the moon eclipse
We do the usual shit she gon' need lube for this
Cause I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world she like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events lord
I'll kill a nigga right now, I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put a nigga's body in an ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than, these niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up to the skyline
Thinking to myself you only live twice slime
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place where the high crime rate Iran
We put your ass on nigthtline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline but they never try mine
Spinning like I'm sipping cyanide
Why my bitch sipping Mai Tai but she wine fine
And I'm so sorry she said don't be sorry
Then she said don't apologize for shit cause you the shit and we know the Carter V the shitBitch I'm the truth! and I would I lie?
I walk up in this bitch like a pilot I'm fly 
Hello and bye-bye

I'm a OG bitch can't you spell? 
Fuck wrong witch ya'll?
I ain't Marvin Gay, but I can get it on witch ya'll

Let my heart do the talking
Listen up princess
I wake up in the morning, take a knee and thank God
Then go to the mirror, look myself in the eyes
Today I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Yesterday I didn't wake up with a woman on my side
Neither the day before that, nor before that
I just remember the moments, call me Kodak
And know that I do miss ya
But it's your denial that I must hold against ya
Since you been gone
I have been all alone
But alone is steroids, 'cause it made me strong
Girl, hair gone in the wind
Ya cheated on God's son, baby girl, that's a sin
But I forgive you
But I can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rearview

Goddamn

A magnum latex goes on the pace goes on
I take a bitch to a island you take a ho to the mall
I holler once and shake a ho to the alphasician

Hit a track and I stink it
You ain't met a nigga like me in while my type extinct, bitch
That's like Noah with no arc
They calling my thoughts the Maxwell house so dark
Step up on the mound with no bark
Pedro Martinez with my mean ass
No matter how old a nigga

It ain't a gang
Without a gangster in front of that
I Play ThatI pop my trunk and everybody get to running
The "fireman" bitch like my body in the oven
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryin' to get a dozen
My name like honey, it got a lot of bitches buzzing
The neck of the barrel is so long and narrow
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunchin' and Monch like Pharoahe
Bloodshot eye's on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on-point like an arrow
Street nigga baby I'm in love with the gravel
Money gives me life like a man with a gavel
I'm strapped at home, I'm strapped when I travel
I pop my trunk and made them bitches spread like cattle
Live from the 504 it's Mr. Crazy flow
Jumping like a bungee no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go
Nowhere I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
See you can smell that I smoke
And yep I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water yep I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the squid
L-lilly pad niggas l-look at the monster
Y-you don't want to crash like la la labambas
I got them 24 inches, sittin on them Joe Buddens
And the trunk straight jumping, bitch I can't hear nothin'
Though I might do the Spurs, sittin' on them Tim Duncan's
And in that lamborghini, I do donuts like dunkin
How come every bad bitch with a pussy, wanna fuck 'em
But I just feed 'em drugs, and watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was 100, and my wrist was another
It make her pussy wet, I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I should rap with a muzzle
Peyton Manning flow, I just go no huddle
Baby girl gettin' straight dick, no cuddle
You know I'm out this world, I just bought a space shuttleYeah, C3 baby
Young Weezy and Young Curren$y
You understand me?
This how we doing it
Di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls, and girls
Di-diamonds and —
Get 'em
Like five, six chains on
Slick Rick, no patch just frames on
Marc Jacobs Aviators and a V-neck
Ten bitches, ten pistols on the P-jet
In a drop top Madina with the top up
I'm in that bitch getting neck like a shot put
Hundred thousand for the grill, if I lie, I die
Flow sick, so sick, see the cyanide
And here's my most funniest joke: I'm broke
Don't worry 'bout me, the money got me
And I keep the burner on me like an I.D
The Lamborghini orange like vitamin C
And leave a bitch stuck like a kite in a tree
Weezy F.B., the money is the matter
I'm working like a bad bladder, M.O.B
Hailing from the bottom of the map
But standing at the top of the game
Kush got a nigga looking like I could really use a nap
But I'm still out wildin' with the gang
Got diamonds in my chain, more colors than the Northern Lights
Life is a traffic jam but I'm on a motor bike
Zig-zagging past these bastards, laughing at them
I got them suicidal like the doors on the Phantom
Yeah, hot spitter nigga, who you thought it was
Bitches want to hold me in the morning like a coffee mug
I don't try to lock them down cause I am not an officer
I just knock them down in groups of ten
As if I'm in the lane aiming for bowling pins
Then the style switch so quick
Have you thinking that the disc skipped
Pimping serious
Make them bring it back like pass interferance
 
Speed boat, wife-beater
Ballin' like Derek Jeter for every reason
That Testarossa can get ghost like it never seen ya
The same color as sesame-a, diarrhea
The pioneer-a, I am here-a, right here-a
The watch nasty like gonorrhea
Money long like Nia, I appear-a via satellite
Whomever don't like the premiere, he a hermaphrodite
Vegetables up in my ear-a, get it clear
Pretty women want this nigga right here-a like Richard Gere
I switch the gear, and steer and disappear
And if I ever jump off a pier I would probably fly
 Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
I roll with a bunch of untamed guerrillas, head bustas, and sharks
Niggas that's 'bout beefin' - lettin' them K's spark
Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas
Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it
Niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin
They dressin' in black, prepared for combat
Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out
That's what happen to ya tryin' to be hard, runnin' your mouth
Get erased, my nigga 
Look here: I leave no trace, my nigga 
No witnesses so can you see my face, my nigga 
Fled the scene - so you have no case, my nigga- -case, my nigga
Look here: you can play if you wanna get down
Get your stupid ass left where you can't be found

We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up 
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up
I was wrong for a lot of shit that I'mma take to my grave
Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, "Juvenile, stay off them streets."
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', "Fuck the police!"
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed
All they understand is my project English
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up 
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up 
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up 
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up

I run the streets cause I'm real if it's daylight or dark
You a killer, nigga?  Ain't no fear in my heart
I'll go toe to toe with ya or take ya to war
I'll even go K for K with ya - now make your choice
Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'mma sneak ya, nigga
Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas
Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga
Nothin' change - I'm on TV, I don't play with you niggas
Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas
And empty a hundred out that K
Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me
I've been in the game - niggas know what I'm 'bout
So many murders under my belt, I done lost count
If you wanna be another number, my nigga
Go ahead, drop your nuts, and run up, my nigga
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up 
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up 
Now, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up 
Nigga, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up

And we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up 
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up

Hello, world
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy
Glock cookin', boy
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'
Spark or lace somethin'
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible
If I live to be old, it's a miracle
Cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar
Cut off lights, we masked riders
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake
With bars we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up 
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up 
Look, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up 
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up, nigga 
We hit you up, lit you up, twist you up 
And we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up 
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up 
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up 
Boy, look

Damn I'm just thinking home 3 winner
Chirping late night, she had the light up antenna
Voices far from ?
13 speaking like we 23 sometimes I would even miss dinner
Cause talking with you felt more important than Jordan's release when the 17's, remember
I get em, similar to any girl I've mentioned
They only thought I'd mention I'm only playing with your intuition
Your senses sensed that I was different
But too flashy for boyfriend material
But I beg to differ
And this is it I'm showing you more material
Now listen, let's Kiss, like Gene Simmons
I've got a vision, fuck a title
We the perfect image, you and I
No eyein' them, them girls, you be eyein' them, cause they be eyein' him
They water stronger than vitamins
Loving you to death, I didn't expect
Beautiful girls, make you suicidal
I guess I'm dyin' then..

In the middle of the war where my enemy at
I'm running this shit like an Eric Bieniemy back
Cause every time I hit a track I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out: "Where the sympathy at?"
I attack before you begin to react
I'm from the dirt where the Beatles and John Lennon be at
And now these niggas looking yellow like a penalty flag
It's Weezy baby with this hustle until infinity, ya
Like somebody let the dog out the kennel and ran
Whoever did it was a very smart women or man
Cause I'm coming like the stomp of every marching band
I need y'all to arch your hands and pray for me
I need...Heavenly Father, creator of all things
I humble myself, as I bow to your throne
Heavenly Father
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take 
Yeah, I wrote my will just the other week
It was funny, it was only one sheet
And I know there's only one me
But I hope I am everything my son needs
I try and live right, stay on the drum beat
But I'm in the fast lane, in the front seat
I wonder, will I lose control of the Maserati
And hit some tree, just being young me?
Is there a heaven for G's and soldiers?
I can't go to hell, 'cause I'd take over
I feel it approachin' but I ain't scared
I made that bed and I should rest in peace
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take 
Yeah, and everytime I see the sun shine
I drop down and give thanks at least one time
Feeling like I'm living on the frontline
I'm feeling like every second is crunch time
I've had breakfast, will I make it to lunchtime?
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for punchlines
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime?
I don't know the answer, that's why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night
Pistol on my lap at every single red light
Yeah, I made my bed right
So when I do I should sleep tight
In peace I rest 
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take 
Bury me a gangster 'cause that's what I live
Don't cry for me I gave the best I could give
I can only do me, so that's what I did
And I cherish every breathe of my kid
And I don't wanna go before she grow, that ain't cool
But in this game of life I don't make the rules
Shit, so that's why I get twisted
So I can't feel it when it hits me
And my moms don't need that owner
But I see death around the corner
And if he, so I just gotta make my way around the block
You gotta answer the door when he knock
 Belee that
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake
Before I sleep I pray to the Lord
My soul to keep and if I should die
Before I wake, I pray to the Lord
My soul to take for Goodness sake 
Creator of all things
I humble myself, as I bow to your throne

Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day

Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that’s grindin'
 Perfect timing
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Than peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that
Scoob, find another oo-wop

Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out

I sip some nigga, and I flip some nigga
Imma uptown stunna, what the hell you think
Ready for war, but I ain't captain of no goddamn tank!
And you can take that to vegillity boy
I'm burning up, I'm on fire is you smelling boy
Cause I be coming with the top down
Letting them know how the chop sound
100 rounds tore the whole entire block down
Assault rifle with a drum and beam totter
38 with a speed loader in my holster
Mac uzi achine with a strap around my shoulder
But if I pop my trunk I'm might just set off a damn explosion
I'm off the wall, off the hook, off the chain
Got a sawed off tec and I'm bout to knock off your brain
Tell em'
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!
Come on, nigga Come on, time to do it nigga
Nigga Come On, Nigga Come On Wodie!

Lemme show 'em why..w-w-what it take...
I ain't gonna say why I'm better than others
'couse i ain't better than nobody, actually
But lemme show 'em why I'm a lot different from everybody else
Because...and what I mean by everybody else I mean everybody else that does what we does
You know, this recordin' industry, music, thing
What I do is, I don't go out to the clubs
And when you do see me in the club, trust me, I have been paid to be there for those thirty minutes that you enjoyed with me
I don't stay inside for nothin' couse my house is nice
I don't just get in my cars and just ride around neighborhoods where no girls are at, because my car is nice
I don't do that
What I do is, I go to studio
And I just stay in the studio
See you have to understand the difference
The difference between me and you is to you, this is your job
To me, this is my life
The club; that's my job
The mall; that's my job
Your neighborhood; that's my job
This studio; this is my life
This is what I do better than anything
So why wouldn't I do this all the time?
See that's the difference between you and I
You get money and you get crazy
I get crazy and I get money
And the biggest difference between you and I is...
You love me and I hate youWe now return you to your regular scheduled programming
I'm bout to bring out the whole Young Money fam right now
We gon' set this shit off, my nigga Mac Maine for president
G-series out in the streets right now
Hit a nigga on MySpace or somethin' man
Holla
Day dreamin'
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Day dreamin'!
You already know
What the fuck is poppin'
Baby I'm what's hoppin-a
I keep a Zip-Lock bag full of 'Dro
And I keep a bad bitch wit' me on the low
I'mma be a G until the day that I go
I can feel it in the air
The reaper's comin' slow
Shhh...
I can hear the reaper comin'
But I ain't scared, oh, no, no, I ain't runnin'
Now when I walk past, you might see an extra shadow
Angels on my shoulders are usin' me for a battle
Spiritual warfare, good versus evil
I even fought the demons as a semen
Yes I was brought there, cursed ever since my day of birth
Got a Heaven-sent flow, though it's Hell on Earth
So, with that in mind, I don't live for Prada
I'm trying to stack and mack, and got stigmata
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa
Sometimes, when I flow, they say the southern Big's popped up
They tell me "don't get murked, or get locked up"
But I'm from Holly Grove, I can't give the block up 
So til' the day they drop my box, fuck
I'ma ride with my Glocks up
You already know
I'm hitch hikin' on the highway of life
You might see me on the side of the road
I asked the Lord to be my coat and umbrella
'Cause outside it's rainin' cold
It's so cold
It's so cold
It's so cold 
It's so cold
I say, Miss America, Land of the Free
You ain't never do nothing for a brotha like me
You sold me a dream of 40 acres and a mule
Then you turn that half-a-acre that I had into a pool
You get up on the news, lying about how the levy's broke
Now Weezy lost 2 Jags, and spitta's Chevy broke
Flooded out engines, messed up suspensions
You took everything we had, Uncle Sam, you Satan fanWe pimpin' over here

Well, I'm young Weezy F. Baby

Let's fucking go, it's Hollygrove
Bussin' straight through the fucking do'
You fucking know them calicoes
They go blucka blucka
You better have a vest baby
Only if I don't shoot to low
Make your chest do the Tootsee Roll
Turn your face to a pussy hole
Turn my bullets to dicks
And I'm making love to your shit, like a bitch
And I bet that you gone love my sex baby
Now say my name like Beyonce

Knock on wood, my mama good
Knock twice 'cause she gave me life
Don't forget that, your honor could
Man, niggas be jacking these days
Only thief I know is Robbin Hood
But I'll pay for that trial nigga
Gotta protect my lively-hood
Look at all the bullshit I've endured
My lawyer said I matured
Talking 'bout them dead presidents
Breath smell like embalming fluid
Vacation, vacation
Keep the weed in rotation
Don't give up the location
I'll send you back to population
Man, I feel like making donations
And I don't need no standing ovations
I bought my bitch some new shit
And told her I don't care if you break it, it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Money don't matter
Money don't mean nothing to me
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
It ain't nothing to me, money don't mean nothing to me
It ain't nothing to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
You understand me, baby girl? You don't have no worries no more when you fuckin' with this
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga
Money's never a problem
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I got money to burn, fire hazards
Lil Tune the monsoon
Cash Money mascot, it's hot under this costume
Got rugs I never stepped on
Beds I never effed on
I'm in that upper echelon
Your empty pockets echoing
I still ride for my niggas
Money don't change a gangster
And when I'm asked to pull a few strings
I pull 'em until they untangle
And I like nice things and bad bitches with cab fare
More money, more problems
I'm surprised I still got black hair
I feel like a vacation, vacation
We gon' need vaccination
Don't give up the destination
I'll send you back to population
Man, let's leave out our situations
Leave our tribulations
I got old money, generations
Where's my cheque book? I'm spending pages, it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Some niggas might call it trickin', we call it takin' care of your broad
Jesus saves, I spend it, nigga, yeah
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I told the bitch it's just money
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
I swear to God we gon' ride high, and stay fly, and stay high
Yeah, yeah, yeah, money don't mean nothing to me
You understand me, baby?
It never really mattered too much to me, to me
Ain't nothing, money don't mean nothing to me 
It ain't nothing to me
Just ball, baby, just ball, baby
It don't mean nothing
I already paid that price
Money don't mean nothing
We do this shit every night
Yoppas in the middle of the ocean
Helipads, chefs
You understand me?
Baby, we ain't even gotta go to the mall
The mall will come to us
Just the prize of the life 
Blinded by the light 
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night 
Blinded by the light 
Blinded,  Blinded
Blinded by the light
You see my chain glow, follow that rainbow
I can put bangles around yo ashy ankles
I hope you get the picture, like Kinko's
That I love you overall, like paint clothes
Baby, Wayne knows what you like
Now baby gon' shine, cause you bright
And me plus you equals too bright
Baby they gon' be
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Blinded, Blinded
Blinded by the lightWhen you look into the mirror in the morning
Co you recognize who you see
When I look into the mirror in the morning
I don’t see anything
What happens when the sun don’t rise and the birdies don’t wana sing
And even the flowers of the day die and then they stink
And then they shrink
And even the friend of mine says the shrink might work
And I was thinking bout clearing my mind but im afraid it might hurt
And just when it seem that I got the whole world at my door
The bell ring and I open up with a bang
Im ready for the world im ready for you girl
Im ready for the world im ready for you girl
Im ready for whatever for now and forever
Im ready for whatever for now and forever
Im ready for the worlld the the the world

Fruity niggas suck a dick fuck the world, I'd rather fuck a bitch

And we gon' be rich forever

Rich forever, sitting on leather
If you hating god bless you like you sniffed some pepper
I'm on an island where it's quiet and the fish is speckled
With a bitch I call JJ for jiggling Jello
Lord rich forever, kiss the bezel
Rubies in the watch face, it came with the freckles
Got a black card to pay for all the incidentals
And my house so big I hear my whispers echo
Lord rich forever, forever and a day
Trying not to confuse the gas pedal with the brake
I just made a multi-million dollar settlement today
I'm talking shit, you can't imagine all the peppermints I ate
A couple hundred thousand here, it keep the federal away
A couple hundred thousand there and now I'm settling a case
Walked straight up out the Rikers like I never spent a day
And the money like pussy, it's better when you chase, lord
Gotta chase that money 
Gotta chase that green 
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens 
And we gon' be rich forever 
We gon' be rich forever

We are coming for the crowns 
We are kings and queens 
And we gon' be rich forever 
We gon' be rich forever 
Rich forever, lit forever
I'm higher than pitch and treble
I just sip and I twist them pedals
My bitch is special
I stay busy, she be salty like a twisted pretzel
Lord busy schedule, misfit rebel
When the money come, the bitch sing Christmas carols
Pistol several, rich but careful
Still wondering when they gon' make a triple barrel
Got money on my mind and I don't see a limit
Tell my girl I'm coming right now, I'ma be a minute
She said "The money more important" and now she offended
I say "You damn right," she say "Stop agreeing with me"
Niggas copy me and mimic, they just comedy and gimmicks
Put your money where your mouth is, I'ma be the dentist
I swear I'ma get the money constantly consistent
I'll be rich forever, I'ma be a minute, yeah
No more  for the electric bill
No more  and we can barely get our fill
No more scraping by
No more living just to die
Gotta chase that money 
Gotta chase that green 
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens 
And we gon' be rich forever 
We gon' be rich forever 
Gotta chase that money

When its her that I’d rather be doing
But right now I’m in the studio making this track

She blowin’ up my phone
She tells me she’s alone
I say I won’t be long, let me finish this song
But right now I’m in the studio eating this track
My girl at home begging me to come back

And she don't even like football, she just sits home
But she love it when I run it in her inzone
She love to role play and put them wigs on
Yeah, she be gettin her lil' kim on
With me, she can be as freaky as she is, but with him she gotta be as sneaky as she is
And with her, I can be as kinky as I'm gonna be
Upside down, handstand's how I wanna be
She said...
She don't even care about her boyfriend
She said she just wanna do the thang with a g
And who is he to tell that girl no when this world is so cold, why should he be

I don't threat the po-po's cause I don't respect the po-po's
Many say that I possess a dope flow, and I accept
Cause when I'm being Weezy I'm at my best
And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
"Just as sure as my name is D'wayne" 
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know

The small boy sliding out a large toy

The flow deserving ovation so clap your hands to it
The flow is real so A-man to it, jam to it

..hand, blew it because the bands who damn igloo it
..and I ram the damn dick to your people's people/
Get mo' booty than Benzino's single, from bi-sexual to bi-lingual
After I sex you up it's "bye skeezer"
And I see you later baby, I'm a player
The chrome wide, fee on the five g/
I sit deep wit my heat 'case shit gets steep
Weezy a dirty south boy, I eat pig feet
I'm just me.. foreal, I'm just me
And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
"Just as sure as my name is D'wayne" 
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know
And nah I'll pro'lly never kill nobody, but I've pointed my pistol
And those of you who I pointed it at, I'll still kill ya
I'm still familiar wit the hustle
I could go dope, weed or coke, bet I'll never see broke
And I know to never say never but whatever, I never felt better than now
I'm 19, I'm a veteran now
When I.. step out my house I need weaponry now
Fuck around and I bet it be bloaw, YEAH!
And they.. wondering how I get so rich as a child
Remember, I was before Romeo and Bow Wow/
Shit, I had O's way befo' Romeo or Bow Wow
But no disrespect my daughter crazy bout 'em
And.. notice how you notice nothing's fake about me
There's something great about me
And I'm still young so there's plenty more to break about me
And people brace yourselves, place yourselves in these 7 and a halves
You don't know the half, and tell me who can walk my path
Not a soul
Your boy live his life on the edge.. Geronimo
..the endge, Geronimo!/
And even if I wanted to I can't change... I'm gangsta!
"Just as sure as my name is D'wayne" 
I say I'm gangsta.. y'know
I can't change, I'm a gangsta!
This is me people, you can either, love me or hate me
But no matter what I'm a always be me man!
W-E-E-Z-Y, WE!
That be me
There's only one word for me
Gangsta!Hush, hush baby, you don't have to cry
I'm not sorry but I lied
It feel a little bit better when you close your eyes
Cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate me 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my
M-m-m-my lullaby
Uh, I tell her I'm workin', I'm not with these hoes
Yeah, she say, "You better be workin' and not with these hoes" 
I tell her what she wanna hear, not what she don't wanna know
She tell me be quiet and ride me slow, like they got bumps in the road 
Look, what you don't know won't hurt your ass
Girl, 'cause if you knew better, you'd do better, yeah, whatever, shit 
I tell ya "I'm here" when I'm there and "I don't" when I do
And you just want me to tell all of the bitches I care for, it's all about you
And I get that
So when I'm with them, I just hit that
I don't even kiss back, my white lies are pitch black
Believe that and I ain't proud of myself
I can't lie to myself
I said, "Self, gather yourself"
And left her cryin' by herself, whoa
Hush, hush baby, you don't have to cry
I'm not sorry but I lied
It feel a bit better when you close your eyes
Cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate me 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my 
M-m-m-my lullaby
Huh, I tell her, "Don't worry, it's not 'bout them hoes"
She just be hopin' whenever I'm worried, it's not  'bout them hoes 
Huh, she act like my stories are not gettin' old
But I know she'd rather hear what I tell her, not what she not bein' told 
Okay, I lied to you 'cause the truth hurts
And it hurts me too, I would cry with you but I gotta work, I gotta work 
She say, "You better be workin' and not with these hoes"
But I drive 'em so crazy like I got the wheel on the wide-open road
And I zig-zag
And when I'm with them, I just hit that
We don't even kickback
Chit chat, not chillax
Believe that
And I ain't proud of that shit
I can't lie about that shit
I say, "Self, snap out this shit"
And left her crying 'bout that shit, woah
Hush, hush baby, you don't have to cry
I'm not sorry but I lied
It feel a bit better when you close your eyes
Cl-close your eyes
Hush, hush baby, you don't have to cry
I know you hate me 'cause I'm right
Just close your eyes, this is my
M-m-m-my lullabyWhaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
Or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings
And z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Weez - anything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicodins, Valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people
When I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'mma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
Nigga, y'all gon' respect Weezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', "Stop!"
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed
On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee
And if we beef, we don't beef long cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
Cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than "The Three Lil Pigs'" last damn house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, nigga - Weezy Wee tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind
Tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'mma tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich cause I wan' shine
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes

A Glock, a magnum, a rusty M3
Rappapompom, we don't want no rom pom pom pom
Survival of the fittest it is well known there's no water like my city's

A Glock, a magnum, a rusty M3
Rappapompom, we don't want no rom pom pom pomNo one knows what it's like
To be the bad man 
Behind the lies 
No one knows what it's like to be hated 
To telling lonely lies 
There's a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that's sorta unique, cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep and I'm stillmatic
The way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still
It's like tryin to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped just knowin any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if
Bush rapped I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny I ain't even hungry
It ain't even money you can't pay me enough
You to play me
Is cock-a-mani you just ain't zany enough
To rock with shady
My noodle's cock-a-doodle
My clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose
Yeah the whole kit and caboodle
I'm just brutal
It's no rumor I'm numeral uno
If Assuming
There's no humor in it no more
You know I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need fag to come a tear a new whole in my ass
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind the lies
No one knows what it's like to be hated
To be faded
To telling lonely lies
Damn I ain't never kill nobody I promise

You gone hafta to rewind this track
And make me go back that thing'll go 'lack''
That boy'll lay flat so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm an I'm masturbatin
Black peter pan fly till I die

Behind the lies 
No one knows what it's like to be hated 
To telling lonely lies 
I'm dealing with some shit homie
It's in the back of my head

The whole worlds throwin stones at me
Like they all got a bone with me
Got a childs mother and I hate her to death
But that's my childs mother so that's my
Mate to the death it's wow how I love her for
For putting little me here
And me and her could be forever
She gonna still be there
Then it's some other niggas

That I ain't tending to, cause I gotta enough problems
An my solution is to stuff problems
But if something goes wrong with that
Then it's back to Pcp and so long with rap
See I'm depressed lately

So ya'll been hearin and seein me less lately

Part 2, Check me out
Yeah, Uh
I fell in love with a pedestrian
'Cause she walked right over me
I should run over that bitch at a crosswalk
In my new Mercedes, I forgot to dance when she played me like a ukelele
Huh, just another sad love song
Like Toni Braxton, should've played you like a saxophone
At least we coulda made music, instead of trippin'
I bought the bitch a dozen roses with eleven missin'
Huh, she said she wanna be a lifeguard
Bitch, you can't even save yourself, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Huh, I park my dick up in her garage
But I shoulda treated that pussy like a parking lot
Yeah, the players fucked up
She was loose as a goose but I should've ducked
Her, and sure, I still hit her up, but only to say I fuckin' hate you, bitch
I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face 
And now my life is lookin' up now 
And she's already been replaced 
I don't need her, you know I don't need her
I don't need her anymore 
No, I don't need her
She know I don't need her 
But now she's seemin' insecure 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, okay I got a new one
And she never pissed me off
That's a toilet bowl, no urine
And I used to think about you when I be wit' her
Oh, now you fly?
Bitch I knew you when you were a caterpillar
And homicide, crosses my mind
Once or twice I admit
I feel like an asshole, that ain't never have shit
Now some say love is a drug I beg to differ
'Cause I sniffed her, and I smelt another dick on her breath
And still kissed her
Fuck I'm stupid
I kidnap cupid
And teach him how to hate
Then teach him how to skate
No, you ain't on my calendar, but at least I got a date
To drown you out I buy a house, buy a beach and buy a lake
I fell defeat to my mistakes, but who doesn't?
I heard your man was gay
Does that mean you have 2 husbands?
You fuckin' slut
I'd do better fuckin' sluts up the butt
Then let you come and kiss the shit out my dick, pucker up
Ha
I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face
And now my life is lookin' up now
And she's already been replaced
I don't need her, you know I don't need her
I don't need her anymore
No, I don't need her
She know I don't need her
But now she's seemin' insecure
Yeah, yeah, yeah
See, when times get hard
So does my dick
And for some funny reason
I think of you
And um
I just wanna grab a rifle and
Shoot myself in the head because
I-I-I just can't get rid of the thoughts
Bitch
I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face
And now my life is lookin' up now As a matter of fact, let me take that rifle
And she's already been replaced And I'ma um
I don't need her, you know I don't need her I'ma swing by your crib
I don't need her anymore And um

She know I don't need her I-I still got that key
But now she's seemin' insecure That you gave me
Yeah, yeah, yeah Ha
Hold up, hold up
Let me find that key
Alright, I got it
Yo, fuck both of y'allOh my goodness
Uh
I turned my mansion to a juug house
I did a TV show with Jesse off of Full House
Oh lord, I turned my mansion to a ho house
I did a show way in Haiti, bought the Zoes out
I rolls out in the car with the head missing, the hoes out
Closed mouth, don't get fed shit in the cold drought
Old south habits, I pour it up, you pour it out
I left the court house with a stroll, bounce and no doubt
I know I'm no slouch if Hov vouch, my doors sprout
I help my bro out and get him out the dope house
I never sold loud since that old couch that fold out
Like the pronounce that I am on a whole ounce
Stank so loud like old trout and toes out
Make these hoes crouch, then roll, bounce, then roll out
And kick rocks, I started with six rocks, oh lord 
Let it breathe
I started off with six rocks
Made 30 dollars, thank god for hip hop
Didn't stop, I was gettin' guap, gotta diddy bop
And hit the block with my palms itching like chicken pox
Bop jiggy bop, my niggas hot, my bitch a fox
All you niggas mock, you bit my swag like little crocks
Don't give diddly squat 'bout any man or city cops
Pistol in my sock, no lollipops, we lickin' shots
Moms cooked dinner and then the pots went to my pops
He was whippin' rock around the clock, oh, how I watched
Then I got shot and then I dropped, then went in shock
Laid up in that hospital room, soon as the doctor knock
You know I hopped up, bounced back like boom shakala
Got rich at 15 and moved momma out
Got lit at 15, ooh, cotton mouth
Started off with six rocks, it's a mountain now
Ooh, and I ain't climbin' down
I never been a fan of common grounds
I been gettin' green since Bobby Brown
Been meaning to write my wrongs, but I been too busy to jot 'em down
And when you visit, I'm not around
I hope your view isn't from out of bounds
I come to do business, so for your new niggas disguising frowns
When your crew fishing, your body's found
Oh lord, I turned my mansion to the White House
Did a movie with Forest Whittaker, got my lines down
Ooh, but my mansion still a ho house
Did a show at home, bought my bros and no foes out
I rolls out in the coupe with the doors out, the whores out
My flow is like a shoe with the soles out, Dr. Scholl's vouch
I knows how to move with my nose down
Keep my nose out of people business, news and hoes' mouth 'cause these hoes foul
My pops from the goose, I'm from Eagle Street, Hollygrove child
I used to have the Nissan with Bose sound, I drove around
Chrome 44 with the gold snout, take your crown
Extended clip that poke out, reload rounds
Sex with a bitch, deep stroke, ouch, she so aroused
Next to the bitch is a coke pile, your hoes mouth
Mine goes down, swallows child with no chow
That mean no teeth, holy cow, slow it down
Yeah, I guess I'm hoin' now
I never been a fan of knowin' vows
I been gettin' green, I mean more than cows
Been meaning to settle down, but I be jugglin' hoes like a clown
And if she gullible, I like her style
If she bisexual, I dyke her out
And if she flexible, if she flexible, I'll wrap her 'round
Get head and pussy, call it cap and gown
Oh lord
No ceilings
No feelings
You all in your feelings
I'm like fuck your feelings

Dwayne Micheal Jr, born that

So I sold that
OG’s from the block told me "Youngin hold that"
So I held dat
Got on front street and then I fell back
Became well at cookin it til it smell flat
Vaseline it up and ship it out in gel packs
I failed at what the teacher used to yell about
Junior High was prison
High school was the bail out
But my momma knew her baby boy was fresher
Than a baby bottom in new Pampers on campus

Kick door, hands high or get your knees blacked
If I don't take everything I'ma be back
And I'm stickin to my word like bees wax
He acts an asshole for these stacks
C Notes not B Flats, ya understand me
Few leaves left the sole tree standing
Just as quick as the wind blew they went too
I’m in too deep, my roots go deeper than the spot
Where their bodies shouldn’t sleep
I probably shouldn’t speak like that
But it be like that
Never let a nigga with a knife see my back

Lets do something for the streets
Listen...
Shh...
D-Boy in the B-U-I-L-ding
He who buy and sell things
Feds hear my cell ring
Phone we say ice cream
Home we say white 
In jail they don't say too much the codes ain't safe enough
So i'll be on the street and on the road gettin' my paper up
Full but I ain't ate enough
I'm good but I ain't great enough 
Aye tru turn the faders up
I'm waking up I'm taking up the industries space and I'm wastin' 'em 
They can't look me in my face and I'm grillin' 'em 
How my smile worth a million 
Because diamons are forever
Pluck a diamond from the bezel
Feel the clarity that twinkle on the little one
Aye
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' it
I'm feelin' myself
Aye what is this feeling?
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' like....
You got to feel me!
I spit switch blades for the bitch made
I spit sweet lemonade for the pretty babes 
I spit bullets at hood niggas
Don't get shot get low boy!
I spit numbers for the dope boys
And the dope boys 
I tell 'em to meet coke boy
It's more money involved
Yea
More money more problems
More problems to solve
Big Gleezy got 'em 
Ask a nigga have I ever been in the back of a car
Lookin' for other niggas after dark 
They'll tell you whats up
I ain't bad as fuck but I'm tough enough
That's why...
People try to tell me shit but I don't want to hear 'em
Cause if I tell 'em shit back
Then I'll probably scare 'em
Truth be told I'm the hottest of my era
There will never be a soul that can compare to every level
Ever peddeled by the Devil
Me being the Devil
Yep
Hot Boy 'till the grizzle
Gone 'till they miss me
And thats untill the blunts burn out
And the liquor is empty
I ain't trippin' cause I did me
Wait I'm trippin' cause I'm still me
Still the little nigga goin' out to get me
If the public got something to say
Well tell them I got something to say
And that is...What?
What?!
Look-
Okay, let's cut the crap
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap
I only stick with that cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat
I be dipped in black
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out
Cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow
Unlike no other, I'm real gutta like bad bowls
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow
Is that so?
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die
Look
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?
I'mma strap up and slam his parent's street
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease
There has to be some explanation for this insanity
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy 
Now give me the dank
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank
What's your kid gonna think?
Come home and find your wig in the sink
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys
They know Weezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys
Never catch me unattatched without them plastic toys
It get drastic, boy
Niggas that's askin' for it
Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga
Who? Weezy, nigga
It's Weezy, nigga
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die
I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes
Two pistols, desperado gun busta
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick
Cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'
When we all knowin' that Weezy have never been fake
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face
Who want this Weezy, nigga? Who want this Weezy, nigga?
Weezy, nigga; Lil Weezy, nigga
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
It's Weezy, nigga - Lil Weezy, nigga
Don't tangle it, nigga
It's time to step down, ya heards meTimbaland on the beat, nigga

Diamonds blingin' on me like they blinkin' on me 
All about my Ben Franklins homie
Bitch can't even get a Abe Lincoln from me
I ain't thinkin' normally, nigga
Bring a tank and all of that with you 
Cause you know I'm from New Orleans, nigga
All I gotta do is just borrow, no limits
Cutting up in a brand new Ferrari my nigga
I'ma get one for all of my niggas
You know I influenced all of these niggas
I just see y'all as my minions
I just see y'all in my menu
I just see y'all as civilians
I don't see y'all as competition
I can see God when I'm squinting
I can't see y'all in my position
I can't see y'all from my condition
I'm wasted
Pill poppin' and pacing 
Prescription medications
Like redemption, revelation 
She pill poppin' and naked 
How can you blame her, she waiting for it to kick in
I kick back when it kick in and let her do what she came for
He don't let her do what she made for and that's messed up
She come by me and get messed up and then fess up
I'm like that sucks and that's cold 
Like glaciers, glaciers, glaciers 
Like glaciers, glaciers
Say that's cold 
Damn shame
He hatin', that's tasteless
He fucked up, good vibrations 
Glaciers, gracious
Racin' in the latest spaceship
No chasin' , no chases
No break in, we made it safely
I'm facin' cases, make 'em disappear like David Copperfield
I'm tasting victory like flavors
They frame us, O'Lord we public enemy like Flavor
I'm famous, O'Lord I always wanted to be so famous
I came up 
Now I kick my feet up and collect my payments 
I'm way up 
I fuck on that bitch and we lay up 
I cuddle and shit, I'm a sweetheart 
I drink all this sip but I stay up 
I pop all theses pills but I stay up 
I fuck up and shit but we made up 
And it ain't trickin' if you got it, nigga
I do all these tricks, I'm a skater
It's all about money and power, nigga
The pussy and shit gon come later 
No time for drama on my conscience
And my shoulders too small to put weight on
And my hoes take too long just to wait on
In the bathroom putting her face on
She say my pole just too long to put bait on 
These niggas be getting their  on and that's cold 
Like glaciers, glaciers, glaciers, glaciers 
And that's cold
Damn shame
That's satin
That's tasty, I'm tasty
She cravin', her favorite tune

Spark it up, and make a nigga block fry again

Wizzle F. Baby, please say the baby

Shut UpCome on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ain't nothin' nice or sweet 
They don't even much understand this 
Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes, I'm drunk and blowed
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
For the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin' from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine, it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues
Look-
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
See me just off the meters
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's Glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy, just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby

Seventeen Carollton, mess with me, I bury one

Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues
Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Weezy cock
And niggas be like Q-Tip cause they breathe and stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop
I grease the Glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me, everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the bluesSome say the ex make the sex spec-tacular

It's no sweat, no sweat
I would never 1, 2, 3, 4-get about you
Your love, your sex
You know I work you out like Bowflex
Our jokes, no stress
Love, live life, proceed, progress
Make sure the neighbors get no rest
We can get together, never disconnect
Your back, your neck
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet... to us
So let's project, you stay in, never in-correct
Lemme catch my breath, talkin' 'bout leaving, you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
Then I'mma send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you leaving the best
So you might have to settle for less

We're done, but it's not over
We'll start it again, after the end of the day
It keeps getting better, don't be afraid
We'll do it togetherI've been woundin, I've been waitin for you
Am pretendin, and that's all I can do 
The love am sendin ain't makin it through to your heart 
Pain, since I've lost you I'm lost too
Nigga feelin like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'll do anythin for a part two, art too
Be friends with her, then you come back to me sayin that you forgive me
Gimme another chance I'm needin it like a kidney
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much
But I fucked, I know I fucked up
I admit I fucked up, but everybody fuck up
Now this another nigga locked up
Tell him me and my clique don't give a fuck
Cause I be from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gansta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster, BANG
You've been brave, never lettin it show
Always tryin to keep it under control 
You got it now, and weather your way to the top 
But there's somethin that you forgot
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everythin, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love right after the fight
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star and the sunlight
See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give back my girl then you give me back my life
Give back my girl then you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin she be in my sight
I remember the time I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap
You've been brave, never lettin it show
Always tryin to keep it under control
You got it now, and weather your way to the top
You know, I see you hidin it mama
But I know you know
I know you do
But I wish you and yours nothin but happiness shorty
But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin room watchin Sportscenter
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings harder than delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma you even went and got a tan drop like me
I remember we was in that home all day
You called me "Butter" I called you "Bay"
My mama asked about ya, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say please don't worry about the women I've been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, DAMN
I've been woundin, I've been waitin for you
Am pretendin, and that's all I can do
The love am sendin ain't makin it through to your heartYoung mula

I’ve never been one who doesn’t take full responsibility for his actions, but damn, I really don’t deserve this. If I hadn’t traded my blue Marc Jacobs jeans, white polo, and gray Vans for green onesies, I wouldn’t have believed this shit myself.
I had to talk to the prison psychiatrist when I got here. I told her that I shouldn’t be talking to her because I’m not crazy … but I ended up really enjoying her conversation. Is that crazy? We talked about traveling the world, where we’ve been and where we would like to go, BUT both of us were in jail … crazy!
My next conversation didn't go so well. As I was being led to the captain's office, I was still just trying to figure out what I was about to go through. I got lost in the thought of how each step that I made was one step farther from everything that I love. And to what? A world of dysfunction, disrespect, and distrust. Come to think of it, it is sort of like the music biz only without the female groupies.
As soon as I sat down in the captain's office, his exact first words to me were, "Don't fuck with my staff!" Damn! Definitely won't be getting any celebrity treatment from the captain. The whole conversation was him telling me, “Don't come in here trying to be what you are. You're not gonna ‘Lil Wayne’ up this mothafucka!”
All I was thinking was, Since there's nothing else to explain here, I'm done with this dude, so just take me to my cell and I'll stay out of your way. After the captain's great words of discouragement, I was handed a towel, two sheets, a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a green cup. Oh yeah, and a cell, cell 29.
As soon as I heard the cell door lock behind me, I just sat on the back wall and the tears began to flow as I took my first glimpse at my new digs: three buckets, one bed, one toilet that was surprisingly kind of clean , a rusty-ass sink with a mirror the size of a small notepad, a desk, and a window. A clothesline was left hanging in the cell. I decided to leave it because I figured it would come in handy.
I got in just in time for chow, which is the overall term used for what they call breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I only ate the veggies because I wasn't too sure what the other stuff was.
I wasn't in the mood to do much socializing, so I kept the first-day meet and greet short. I guess not everybody on staff got the captain's memo because two C.O.’s were suspended for trying to come up and see me ... females of course. Maybe there will be some female groupies in the bitch after all.
Fuck ... one down!
Welcome 2 Da Family
Woke up at 4 a.m. for breakfast "chow." I had coffee that was given to me along with some other "goodies." The guys on my tier made me feel like I was a part of a family ... like a brotherhood. I was the new brother and they showed me love just like one. All in all, they gave me magazines, tea, some better soap than the prison's soap, an earphone radio, and extra chow.
There's Chris, who gave me the radio. He looks 15 years old, like he's in here for stealing gum. There's Lawson, who gave me the magazines and taught me how to use the phone. Twenty-one minutes every five hours. Sheesh!  There's Herb. He gave me some advice on how to do this time. Shit like, make sure to stick to myself, and to create a daily regimen to keep myself busy every day. He suggested working out, but I know my body ain't built for that. There's Al, whose cell is across from mine. He's 50-something, but he acts 20-something. Reminds me of an old Mafia guy. Then there's Coach! The guy that likes guys ... you know it had to be one of those. But he can and will get anything you need. I guess you can call him a "sweetheart," haha!
Now, as far as the C.O.’s, there's one who really stood out. White dude. He's loud, funny, and mad cool. He kept it so real with me from the jump, like, “Stay away from all these bitch-ass niggas ... none of them are your friends.” Him being a C.O., he knew why everybody was up in this bitch. Let's just say that he pointed out all the dudes who became gangstas mysteriously overnight when they found out that I was coming ... haha!
And then there's Ms. Burke. Owwww! She's so sexy! She has a head full of gray hair, but she's not old. I'm not sure what caused it, but she said that her hair has been gray since she was 13. My first impression was that it's just her swag and she dyed it gray on purpose. That's how cool it looks on her. I mean she's fine as hell. I'd definitely hit it!
Still Got It!!!
Shot hoops with Al in the yard. I sucked. He was much better and he's 57! No sooner when I got back to the cell at 2:45 p.m., I was back out to take the test for the suicidal-protection aide job. I passed with a 100, no lie. Guess I still got it. And I guess I still get that moola, baby, because SPA is the highest-paying job an inmate can get. The job is basically to monitor the tier for an eight-hour shift and if someone wants to hang up , to not negotiate with them or try to talk them out of it, but just to alert an officer. Yeah, it's that real.
When I got back to the cell, I wrote some rhymes and did some push-ups until about 4:30. Ended up playing checkers with Dominicano. Lost!
Then I had to get ready for my visit, which was Tez, Mack, and E.I. That was a great visit. I miss them niggas. Had chow when I got back. It was this chicken special that Coach and LL make. Shit was great! Also made my own rice and noodles with it and put it on a tortilla wrap. Shit was awesome. I felt fat.
Used the phone cautiously. Spoke to my little man D.M.C. III, he said, “Da-da.” Fucked up that I had to hear it for the first time in here, but still, Yeah!
Showered up quickly then had tea. It's 10:45 p.m. and I'm back in my cell listening to a game in the earphones as I write this.
Push-ups, prayer, sleep. Another day gone!
Jailhouse Rap
Read fan mail. Got some nice pictures today and Marisa sent me some Marc Jacobs cashmere socks, yeah!
Some people write the most bugged-out things. Everything from wanting to fall asleep with my dick in their mouth, to that I rep my city “astronomically”! Crazy, man! I love it! Also read the new Rolling Stone and I was in it. Yeah!
I rapped for the first time on the yard for Charlie and Jamaica. It's crazy that I've performed in front of millions of people since I was 8 years old, but for some reason I was nervous as hell. Rapping has always been second nature to me, but my creativity has definitely been put to a test since being in this bitch. I absolutely refuse to rap about being in jail. It's not who I am AND it's not who I'm going to be! I hope they liked it. I think they did.
Chris gave me two bags of Doritos. I gave him some bubble gum. It wasn't a trade, just two generous guys. But yeah, someone blessed me with some gum, a Now and Later, and a Jawbreaker today. Yeah!
As a Man
I woke up still feeling fucked up about the fucked-up day that I had. Hell is what it was! I'm used to arguing with my girl on a daily basis, but finding out that she fucked Drake was the absolute worst thing I could've found out.
As a man, honestly, that shit hurt, and not because it was Drake. It could've been any man and it would've hurt the same. She said it happened way before we got together, but she just never told me. When Drizzy came to see me, he was like, "Yeah it's true ... don't fuck with her like that ’cause I did fuck her." Damn!
This is the type of shit that a man never wants to find out while he's locked up. Or maybe so, ’cause only God knows what I would've done if I wasn't locked up right now. As soon as I found out, I told them to just lock me in, and I've basically just been by myself in my cell for the last couple of days.
Not sure how long I would've stayed in there if it weren't for Charlie. His fat ass wasn't going to let me just sit up in this bitch and not eat. He was like, "I don't give a fuck what you're mad about, we cooking no matter what, nigga. Come on man, let's eat!"
As a man I'll admit it: That shit really fucked me up, but hey, fuck that ho!
Love is blind, that's why I say make sure that bitch is a seeing-eye dog.
Another one gone!
He Runs the City
I woke up feeling like today was going to be different for some reason. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there seemed to be a buzz in the building. I had my morning coffee like usual and chilled in the dayroom waiting on my visit. And what a great visit it was. Diddy kept his word and visited me today. It was total chaos! Every captain in the building was down there! Even the deps and the warden! Everyone just wanted to see him. It was kind of aggravating, but it is what it is.
Here No More
Today started out on some regular-day shit, but that's definitely not the way it ended. Jamaica got deported. We were just chilling in this bitch and they just came and got him like he had a visit. The only difference was, they were like, "Jamaica, pack up your shit." Damn!
The fucked-up thing is that Jamaica and I have become ... damn, do I dare use the "F" word in jail ... but really have become like friends. He was always asking me if I could help him out with a lawyer or something just to keep him here because he was facing deportation.
At first, I would just brush it off, but it got to the point that I reacted as if he were one of my homies that I grew up with. I was like, “Nigga, don't ask me for shit just because you know I got it. It's because of me that we're eating right up in this bitch. Don't stretch it by asking for a lawyer and shit.” That's really how I looked at it at the time. I really didn't know it was that serious. I guess he really did need a better lawyer. Damn!
The whole ordeal made me realize how there are no real friends in jail. As fucked up as that sounds, that's the reality. I remember when White told me that. He was like, "Y'all niggas can be as cool as you want in here. You niggas can fight together, eat together, play ball together, and all that shit. But nobody ever gets out of this bitch on the same day. And whoever gets out of this bitch first ain't worrying about nobody ass that still up in here."
I pray for everybody in here, but I really don't see myself keeping in touch with anybody but a couple of C.O.’s who never acted like dicks toward me.
What a day … at least it's another one gone!
What's Really Real
Damn, I woke up this morning missing having normal conversations about everyday shit. The only time that I can have anything close to a normal conversation is with a C.O. I can't even begin to try and have that type of convo with an inmate because they're always lying about whatever they're talking about.
I'd have to be the most gullible mothafucka on the planet to believe the stories that these niggas tell me up in here. I mean like everybody in this bitch is a king, a boss, or a killer ... Everybody either has or has had a billion dollars. It's kind of sad because I know that they're just trying to boost their egos, which is probably why most of these mothafuckas are in here in the first place. Your life has to be crazy as fuck when jail is the place to boost your ego.
I don't ever want to come back to this bitch! There's absolutely nothing cool about jail. It's nasty. It's dirty. Everything is fucking used. Getting something new in the bitch is like winning the lottery. You have to be a certain mothafucka to get new shit. And since I get new bedsheets and shit, it's a good thing that I'm that certain mothafucka!
When I got back from the yard, I just stayed on the phone as much as possible. I was really craving some normal conversation. I'm sure this was all caused by this dude telling me to slow down because I was beginning to act like an inmate.
I got into an argument on the yard and went straight gorilla. I was as un–Lil Wayne as I could get. I was in a nigga face like, Fuck you, nigga, what's good? Niggas had to hold me back and shit. That's when this dude was like, "You go home to something nobody else in here goes home to ... dude, leave that nigga alone. He'll be back in this bitch next month. You don't want to be back in this bitch, man. Don't act that way. Go home, bro. You're a millionaire. You're a superstar. So act like one." I couldn't argue with that shit ... damn ... and yeah!
The Remix, Baby
Who knew that my spirit was about to be lifted through the roof! Tez was like, “We want you to be on Drake's remix.” I was like, “How?” And he was like, “We're going to do it over the phone.” I'm like, “Shit ... I don't have anything else better to do up in this bitch, so let's go!” After I finished running it, I was kinda nervous on how it was going to be received. This was the first time that I haven't been in the studio to hear the playback before a song goes out.
I can't front, I'm really bugging out knowing that I can record a song AND it would be on the radio and everything. My main thought is, Damn ... if I can do this, I'm about to go to the studio every night. I told Tez to have the mic on standby from here on out.
Nothing else that happened today mattered. Nothing can touch how happy I am. My creativity is at an all-time high right now! I'm actually looking forward to tomorrow.
Writing, writing, and more writing! Another one!
So Blessed
Just got back from my visit. I have the best friends, fans, and family in the world. I've been in this bitch for a good minute now and have never missed a visit yet. You get two visits a week and I haven't missed one yet! That shit is incredible ’cause I've never seen Jamaica get a visit. The only visit I saw him get was the mothafuckas who deported his ass came and got him. Coach has never got a visit. Dominicano has never got a visit. Charlie has never got a visit. I got every visit I was supposed to get. I've been able to look forward to seeing someone every chance I was able to see someone ... THANK GOD!
I even feel blessed when I argued with my girl during visits because it would become the topic of my day. And by the time we spoke later that day, the argument was so amplified in my head that I couldn’t wait to jump on the phone with her. Being that she was dealing with real-life shit and not up in the hellhole, she would normally have forgotten about the whole thing and be on some "I love you, Baby" vibe ... I'm like, BITCH!!! That shit might sound crazy, but it's awesome to have something to look forward to that takes your mind out of being in jail!
I told her I didn't want her to wear any panties so I can look at her pussy and shit one time. But since I never wear the same T-shirt, boxers, or socks more than one time EVER, my nigga E.I. always brings me new T-shirts, boxers, and socks every visit. And they have these extensive-ass searches before you come in here, so they made her put on a pair of boxers because they knew she didn't have on panties. Damn!
I have to give props where props are due ... big shout-out to Diddy, Chris Paul, and Kanye for coming to see me, especially with their schedules. I know that they had to go through some extra shit, because you just can't walk in this bitch and say, "I want to see Dwayne Carter.”
It's lock-in, so push-ups, Bible, prayer, slow jams, and sleep. Another one!I'm just a rocka dude
Lookin for my rocka girl
Baby I'll rock your boat
Rock your bed, and rock your world
But you gotta be as fly as me

Switch rides by the day, day, day

This was the question I was thinkin of
Have you ever made love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. mad. love

Keep on I got the heat on 80
At 90 I’m shooting, at 100 I’m blazin
Concrete jungle the wild-life pavement
That’s my life, my life, my life baby
Don’t get caught up in the twilight craze
Or you'll be just another highlight baby
Before I had my aim
I still had a pistol
Missing ya whole chest
Hitting ya whole temple
Like 95, 96 getting it in the rental
So short I had to sit on a pillow
Let the whole quaker sit on the griddle
Cook em up and shoot em out like missiles
Boot em up and call em out like bitches
They ain't nothing but bitches
They ain't fucking with this shit
They swinging and missing
My angle is different, they ain’t seeing me
Look into my music, that’s the window to my soul

I got Maine in the booth
Wayne in the booth
Money on my mind, that mean I'm thinking of loot
Shit, ain't it the truth
Money is the top prio-
"Money Over Murder," that's the title of my bio
We cop drops like it's part of the policy
This hardbody, baby, y'all softer than wallabies
So hush puppies, let the big dogs ride
Don't jump on that field when it's kickoff time
And I, fresher than the Frebreeze bottle
Coming at the shit full throttle
And I power ball like lotto

You niggas is all soft, soft shell tacos
And eyes go deeper than pot holes
For that money, bet I'm running like a snot nose
No Kleenex
Dark shades, V-necks
Bitch, I ain't playing no recess

And it's fuck the world like a nasty bitch
Fuck raps, I bust caps for snaps
I fuck white, I fuck blacks, I fuck Japs
Now what's hap?
I make stacks, ASAP
I take that from the safe and I replace that
Stay strapped
I stay low, stay back
The judge handing out L's like Pat Sajak
And I'm all about my team like an apex
Make you niggas turn your seats into a Playtex
Yes, member of a fly society
Style, I got several varieties
As a child, this guy memorized "Scarface" in it's entirety
The 80s drug era inspired me
That's why I dress how I dress, walk how I walk
That's why I rep what I rep, talk how I talk
Two rope chains, both of them gold
With a gloat like I just came home
Flow touching the pedal in that F-5 yellow
Just moving through the city like blood in the vessel
I'm a fucking professional, so intellectual
It's Mr. Fat Stacks, my pockets got high cholesterol
I need vegetables, is weed vegetables?
I'm past commas, right now I'm seeing decimals
Step to you, the opposite of my environment
Out of all the dogs in the yard, I was the quietest
I had a little bark, I had a little bite
Was surrounded by niggas who snap and don't think twice
To kidnap your enemies, dress them up as Santa Claus and drop their bodies down their mamas' chimneys
Water to your kidneys
My class G like the Bendz G
My truck waving and my rims speak
I got burners on my rear seat
See, I don't say too much, so if talking becomes part of the ballgame, money talk for me, yeah, my ends speak
Yeah, what you expect? I'm from the Hollygrove area
Where we see more redskins than Steve Spurrier
We know the clock ticking, so we planning hurry up offense
Hustling on the park bench, caution
The major bison of the boulevard
The barracuda, fighting off the fish and raw
Yeah, I get around like a business car
And you can see me everywhere but the prison yard
I'm on that sissy hard, and that kush tough
Weezy stay high, just look up
Shook up like a can of Coca-Cola that fell down five flights of stairs, man
Can't hide that you niggas so scared, man
Ahead of my time, I'm the already-there man                                                                              Wassup shorty where you goin' all fuckin' shy tonight?

And now it's time I bring forth to you, what I call my secret weaponI got a story to tell, you know that I cherish these
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
When you really should sleep with a choppa
'Cause you gon' wake up and see me with some choppas
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell 'em, "Get him," they say, "Yes, daddy"
And they don't care how we split it
And they so pretty, and their hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly
I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie 
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli 
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin'
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with ya
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'"
She say, "What's missin'?", "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratch his head, she say, "Get back in bed"
Then she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say
"Ooh, daddy, ooh," woo
She say, "Ooh, daddy, ooh," yeah
She took off his pants and his shoes
He opened his eyes and saw that barrel goin' boom
Nigga, yeah
I see niggas in this bitch
Stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches
And when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place"
And if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She don't want love, she just want her share
She feed him lies with his silverware
I know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told ya"
She say, "Yes, daddy", I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
So we're waitin' outside
We watched him pull up, and walk up to the door
And right before he knock, she open the door naked
They started French kissin', but he didn't see moi
She left it unlocked, they didn't make it to the room
So they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, shoot him dead in his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, we call her a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
And if you alone, she bankrupts you niggas
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Then you wake up and see guns in your face
And Mona Lisa out of frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
We take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga
You more terrified than a Fatter Joe, nigga
Don't be a pussy for pussy, my nigga
Don't be a asshole over pantyhoes, nigga
Quit playin'
She say, ooh, Daddy, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! 
You fuckin' with Wayne's? 
Bitch, gimme your phone! 
Let me, let me take this call real quick
 He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do?
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself

And she's mine, she's mine, yeah, yeah, hol' up, hol' up
I fell from a cloud to her tongue
I fuck her so good, I got to bow when I'm done
She say all she wanna do is get wild and have fun
My hands in her panties, find a diamond in the rough
If they bottled her up, I'd be a lousy ass drunk
Tell her, "Rivers run deep, I'd rather jog than run though"
Tell her, "Swallow that pride, I ain't cutthroat"
Then she sit on the dick proud, like the front row
And we don't care about what you haters care about
So we don't hear about what you hating about
That's why we gon' move in a bigger ass house
With a whole bunch of rooms with no room for doubt
We got too much going on
Oh Lord, she ain't got no drawers on
But she decide if she wearin' em with a coin toss
Hold on, let me turn my phone off
And who gon' love her  if I don't, if I don't
And who gon' fuck her  if I don't, no you won't 
I choose to love her  how I want, all I want
'Cause she's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah
And who gon' love her  if I don't, if I don't
And who gon' fuck her  when I don't, no you won't
You used to love her and you won't, now you don't
'Cause she's mine, she's mine, she's mine, yeah
She never say, "Never say, 'Never'"
She never wake up before 7 PM 
She never dress for the cold weather

Baby mama say I ain't shit
Make a nigga feel like shit
Talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me 'til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave 'em
Where'd I leave it?
I hope I left more of an impression
And all of my blessings for my kids and Miss Cita, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, "You're a son of a gun"
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, "I won't hesitate to fuck a young nigga up", Lord
My new bitch left me
She said she felt too disrespected
It made no sense to me
But not to the people closest to me
And that's why she left
My smile just left
Can't lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I’ll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is
As it appears, oh shit
There go the tears, there go the drank
There go the pills, you know the drill
Sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times and still here
Why am I here?
Dear Life
What is my reason? What am I here for, that's the question?
My children, that was easy. So easy
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, "Nothing's easy"
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real
The shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill
Lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns
I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tag, no mistake, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, "Fuck the world and be so aggressive. Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive"
I don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious
'Cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

I like this vibe
Smoking the good marijuana, man
Sipping the good codeine
What a time
Making money bags out of pillowcases
Making money bags on a daily basis
Tattoos on our baby faces, you can't faze to face us
We was raised by Jason, Norman Bates, and Satan, Hellraiser
Stunt like Jason Statham, the J's awaiting, that's my crazy patients
I got what they craving, they place the payment just to taste their favorite
Now I got 'em raving about my latest, you should check the ratings
Separate destinations for the extras making extra paper
Never giving statements to the agents during interrogation
Well aware with proper preparation skipping devastation
Devil never sleep, no sedation until heaven make us
Dreaming 'bout being in better places until hell awake us
We well aware of jealous haters with their allegations
Don't need them to validate us, need their gals to date us
Need their girls to serenade us with their salivators
But we lit like Talladega, Tunechi Schwarzenegger gone
Hasta la vista, baby
Gone, hasta la vista baby

Oh look, my phone is blowing up
That's your bitch asking to come over, she shall overcome
Oh look my homies showing up, your homies know what's up
It's gon' take some cojones, hope and luck to cope with us, look
We hung right by that corner store with pumps, a lot of dope and bucks
And opened up that box Pandora shut like, keep it closed for what
We keep our noses up to smell the beef
Smell like a rose to us
And all roses must die slow as fuck, we speed it up
We slow it up because we pour it up, you know we pour it up
Trying to coexist with older thugs got us growing up
Knowing much but never know enough, now we loading up
Secret code of trust, keep us holding up and bold and tough
Chin high, eyes forward, shoulders up, protocol, overall
Fight like there’s no tomorrow, soldier  boys, you!
Boy you just fuel to all of my fools
I give you little dudes the slaughterhouse rules
Pardon my drool but yall look like food
All that I do is charter my moves
Sparkle my jewels, harbor my goons
I'm hard on my boos cause all they wanna do is come to my room and walk on my moon
All these lil dudes wanna walk in my shoes
And argue about news that’s all about Tune
When all that I do is whatever I choose
And never let you alter my mood, gone

Yea
And 'Bamas rap but, they lack the passion for it
They lack the vision young Folarin now can labrador em
I reel them in, Goadomes on
See i'm on my Scott Storch stayin' clear of Timbalands 
A beat clubber no thug but the street love em
Why be them but it appears like we brothers
And peace Harlem and the Dipset phenomenon
D.C got ya, we got 'em like you got em on
Yea, my fan base pilin on...
Yea, my haters need Tylenol
And by the way I seen the iTunes hatin', I think it's more racist then ratings
Anyways give it up the capital of the nation
With weapons similar, to dry grapes
Or babies and raisins

Lil Wayne:
If its bullshit you want, bullshit I shall 
Ima kick it off and go heads and tales
Red lobster everyday shrimp heads and tails 
And bad bitches give me head and tail
And bad bitches give me head and tell
See i'm ahead but u stay the snail
I move they see the back of my nikes
Got to the end of the tunnel
And i was the light 
Always strapped so I was alright
Naked woman rub my back
And ask me how was my night
I say- bitch stay out of my business!
When we fuck she say
Just stay out of kidneys!
I say, dont say it if Simon didn't
And America idolize a nigga 
But they better, 'cuz bitch I'm me 
And you are you, too, but bitch im three!

The revolution has arrived
Luchador like I've been masked
But still remain fly
Thats flyer then the wrestler, you don't want to mess with young Rey Mysterio mixed with Chavo Guerrero 
Flyer then the rest of them, make them all remember me
Make em all similar to the mind of an elephant
Mine wreaks excellence, y'all wreaks estrogen
Everybody know me like the Contra code for extra men
Beyond the extremities of everyone or anyone, train of thought runnin' like its Kenny and I carry on
Been in more beef then ceriums I bury em
Always next to madness like Kenyon, I carry on
Flyer then the rest, I told you I'm the 'ish
Watch me exercise my excrement
While sending messengers
DMV's messenger
Love it so I'm reppin' it
Hail to the 'Skins
Rest in peace, Sean Taylor
1Y, colorful like Chapel paint
You hapless fakes should know I'm the master bate
After dates: my place, innate to take out wrappers straight rappin' great
Keep spitin' till my lips bleed
Bury you 6 feet, got your girl fist deep
Your shit's weak, Ripley says mines risky
I take the stick out her mouth, just to let my chick breath
This'll make you spend your rainy day savings
I radiate rabis and I'd maybe date Brady's wife
She's a Brazilian baby from the 80's
Maybe be my lady, spit crazy and amazing
Lately, I been blazing cause I'm sicker than the chicken pox
Hit you with a Sunny Liston shot when the whistle stops
You write simple plots, mine are outlandish
I got a gifted cock, girls say its outstanding, yes-
I'm moving forwards while you stay stuck in sleet
I got a bunch of needs, S.May cut the beat
I'll run this game even if you cuff my feet
Fans love the heat so viewers be like "fuck a beat"
I'm just a beast who will punch a G till his stomach bleeds
Gut check, tough set when your something's weak
Since puberty, weed has been a cash crop
Mad hops on the black top you work the snack shop
The definition of sloppy, ask Webster
Pay attention you copies, I roll the best herb
My brain is lifted, your plagiarism not fresher
Than me throwing 1 down as a catcher
Worship the wordsmith you're worthless and nervous
Surfing the surface with a surplus of servants
Look- I require your undivided attention
Around me don't mention, affection or prevention
Rapin' beats raw dog, like the cats in straw dogs
Hard bars, spit flame like Charzard
I smoke Ivysoar till my eyes are sore, buy some more
Smo
Fuck the rental house, I'm coming through to buy the whole block
No need your temper down, you know we 'bout to party non-stop
You try to rap but you chop, callin' fouls but you flop
If this is Famersville you're the pussy beggin' for crops
You a bottom feeder, Spongebob is your next door neighbor
Easy haters, save it for later, I'm your father Darth Vader
That's a joke invader Zim, I already run the world
No need to say it again, no need to say it again
You see I spit rhymes and dish dimes like my name's Steve Nash
You see I clip mine from the beanstalk, I don't spend no cash
I just watch that ass, as your bitch is cooking breakfast
I'm sexting her best friend, telling' me "wear no protection"
She molested my mind, went on the Maury show to prove it ain't mine
Smokin' blunts all the time, or maybe spliff bowls or papers
Bow to your creator, no time for the bullshit
I'm out I'll see you later, I'm the man like Slater
Getting' pussy and your mascot is the masterbaters
You mad cause I stained her, you a little bitch so you stayed there
I'm the dog trainer, better yet call me the Whisperer
She's suckin' on my dick, and I ain't kiss her
I'm a baller, stackin' money like Griffin off the Clippers
Your a weird mother fucker lookin' for dragons and wizards
Fag well we figured, no need to stop at the bank
I get my money delivered in the same truck as my dankWhen I would think about retiring
Uhh...I look at retirement like, I look at retiring like
You retire out when you die out
Straight up, cause you never retire out what you do
You never retire out of what you do
Meaning, if you put so much into--if what you do is your life, like mine
You know what I mean like, my career is my life
So I could never retire out, even when I stop rapping
I'm going to still be in some kind way or form or fashion in it
You know what I mean like
When I die there's going to be rappers at my funeral, hopefully
You know what I mean
But, you know what I mean that's just how it is
Or, y'all gonna remember that that was a rapper
But hopefully, I'll go down known for something different--
Not different, but known for something else also, you know what I mean
But that's what I'm going to do, hopefully
I know what I'm going to do, I'm that nigga manYEAA!
