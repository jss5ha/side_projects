# Side Projects

This repository contains an RNN, text files it needs to work correctly, a webscraper, and a folder containing Python demos I wrote when I taught middle schoolers the summer between my second and third year at UVA. The RNN is a generative RNN, which takes in the lyrics from a given artist and user generated “starter text” as input. The text files were generated using a web scraper for the site genius.com. I used this scraper to get the lyrics (including profanity, which likewise can be in the output) for the entire discographies of some of my favorite rappers, which are fed into the net. 

The folder PiDemosForStudents contains five small python programs I used to help students learn Python basics during the week long courses I taught when working for Mindframe Education. In addition to teaching Python, I taught the basics of Linux with Raspberry Pi devices. Of the programs in the folder, the most interesting is the Whack-A-Mole game. It is integrated with the Pi's GPIO pins, and when four lights are plugged into the pins the Pi will randomly turn on one of the lights.  The user then presses either the 1, 2, 3, or 4 keys, whichever corresponds with the lit bulb. If the correct number is input, the light will shut off and a new one will turn on, otherwise the player loses the game. This program was the culmination of the concepts I taught over the course of the week, and was loved by the students.
