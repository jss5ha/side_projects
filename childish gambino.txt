I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh
If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh

But stay woke
But stay wokeNo matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet 
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up

'Til 3005, hol' up 
Hol' up , hol' up 
Hol' up , hol' up 
Hol' up , hol' up 
Hol' up 
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up
No matter what you say or what you do 
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you 
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up 
Hol' up , hol' up

Different color, my passport

Hashtag my day wear, and your girl drank my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair, it's silver spoon coon, ho
Ain't nobody sicker in my Fisker, “vroom-vroom,” ho
Ain't nobody—
Top of the holy totem
Ri-ri-ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, trippin' off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
And I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that A-K-A
White hood, white hood, O-KKK
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati, you whippin' a Kia
Spendin' this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Wakin' up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
“Err-eh-err-eh,” onomatopoeia
Ohh, I got my cool on! 
I'm winnin' so they had to dump the Gatorade 
And I don't give a fuck about my family name
What?
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you

Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do? Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E's
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like "nigga" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, "grrr", Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
“You're my favorite rapper now”, yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin, kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?”
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit, "First of all, you talk white
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' "Ow"
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
'Cause all I did was act me, like a Looney Tune
And I'll give you all of me until there’s nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp, bitchI wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
'Cause
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go 100
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
69 is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smoke
And light
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money, then you burn me, then you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something? In between that?
I wish we never fucked, and I mean thatAlright, Gambino is a mastermind, fuck a bitch to pass the time
Mass appeal, orange rind, smoke your green, I'm spendin' mine
The beat is witches brew, but beware, this shit is potent
E.E. cummin' on her face, now that's poetry in motion
Yeah, Gambino make it work, I'm the boss, move somethin'
Yeah, this cool fuckin' suits me, swag two button
Yeah, these girls be actin' crazy when they're dancin': Black Swan
I ain't fuckin' at the club, put your clothes back on
Yeah, this beat is a disaster, 9/11 this track
Rappers wanna battle me, I have to mail their heads back
And my clique make that dinero, so it's time to meet the fuckers
I am runnin' this bitch, you are just a dog walker
Leavin' with your girl when we last seen each other
Yeah, you fuckin' with the baddest like we tag team Rihanna
Fly girl on her knees, she don't wanna come near me
Yeah, my dick is too big, there's a big bang theory
Got her picture in my iPhone, what do y'all think?
While y'all niggas masturbate, I'm in that Ariel Pink
If I am just a rapper, man, you could've fooled me
I'm the shit, when these dudes talk, they talkin' bull me, ah
Yeah, rah, rah, okay
Alright, I'm down with the black girls of every single culture
Filipino, Armenian girls on my sofa
Yeah, I like a white girl, sometimes we get together
Need a thick chick though
So it's black and yellow, black and yellow
Love is a trip, but fuckin' is a sport
Are there Asian girls here? Minority report
Put your team on the map, Blake Griffin on the court
Niggas bitin' off my tracks, need a knife and a fork
We the illest, need a nurse, here's the check, grab your purse
Unless we fuckin', then I'll pay for all the food on the Earth, man
I got some pussy that was insane
So insane, it's an enemy of Batman
I'm dominant, niggas call me faggot 'cause they closeted
I'm hot as shit, comin' out the backside of a rocket ship
It's monster shit, you dudes are the opposite of Loch Nesses
Respond to this, we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin' with my n-words, say it like a white kid
Yes, your booty's big as hers, say that to my white bitch
So she don't get embarrassed, my dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin' to be fed it, I meant honeys, oh, forget it
I have worked all winter, I will not fail summer
In the back of a bush, like Gavin Rossdale's drummer
Yeah, my stinger's in her flower, I hope she let me pollinate
Workin' hard as shit, yeah, this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga, can't you tell that my sample of Adele
Was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowin' up my cell?
Swag out the ass, I'm the man, fuck chico
Took the G out your waffle, all you got left is your ego
Think about it for a second
Man, we eatin', where's your breakfast?
Man, you hungry, have this sandwich
Got my wallet, cheese, and lettuce
An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everything
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame
Runnin' the game, fuck am I sayin'?
Runnin' the Earth, give me a month
Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it
'Cause havin' an Emmy just wasn't enough
You get sloppy drunk, I stay whiskey neat
My clique should be cancelled: Freaks and GeeksPower 106!
LA, it's ya girl, Yesi Ortiz
Got some brand-new music
I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think
It's Lloyd, called "Oakland", on Power 106
I was making Japanese
And she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5
And she waits til' I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me "turn around," then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
And I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay
Babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, and oh
I don't really mind the drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I needed
Now that I got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So treated
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
But I'm really not ready, girl
That's a problem
'Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know you choose to stay, and oh
All the girlfriends saying "here we go again"
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes...right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try
Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move
And we'll both be thirty soon
In Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you, so the fuck I'm supposed to do?
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland

At a Clippers game on the courtside 
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five 
They mad at me too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you "Go home, Roger"
Tia and Tamera in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid 
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys, and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playing PlayStation
Why you standing there? Say some
Girl, say some, no, this ain't a vacation
This is my house, my house, all she needed was some

That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around
When you wanna play pool or my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a ménage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I, I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I, I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors...

Hoes is hoes is hoes, man

All I got is tracks, man
Sorry for my accent, but I’ve been practicin’
Everywhere ya go niggas blastin’ that Gambino
Niggas be like, "You ain't know?"
Bitches be like, "You ain't know?"
Met this fly Latino
Hope that she eighteen though
If she not, I’ll say that I got deep throat in Heath-row
I'm on my ballin' each and every day
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
You see me, babe? You see me babe?
Asian girls everywhere, UCLA
Told me I was shit, but that shit couldn't stop me
Nigga still hungry, black Kobayashi
When I talk about you I hear a "Who?" like Horton
I was born for this shit, you a rappin' abortion
Can we hear the N-word one day and not get upset?
Can we try something new and not be suspect?
I don’t really know, we fucked up bad
You don’t wanna see my dudes when they get mad
I got a bunch of jackanapes at the back of me
That’ll lacerate anyone in the back of a matinee
And laugh while they masturbatin' all over your beaten body
Sick Boi forever, that Suburban Illuminati
Nah nigga, yeah, we never stop
No period like menopause
No period like, "Oh shit! Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"
"Am I the only one you sleepin' with?"And now that it's over, I'll never be sober

Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
Oh honey now girl, give it one night
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we can be
No, no, no...
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that it's over, I'll never be sober

They wanna see us falling apart
You know that I love you
So let me into you
Let me into your heart
(Do you really love me?

This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars

You can see us far then near
Let me into your heart
Oh, this ain't no bullshit

Oh, oh God
Girl you really got a hold on me

Yeah, I murder some, murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah, what you saying to it?
Old money look, no money don't do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ie
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
 What's the rationale?
They wanna smoke niggas when they black & mild
So we acting out—okay, cool
Where, where, where, where

Blue dream by the bouquet

Gut niggas, so Kurt Vonne
Elle Varner, got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that

We're headed nowhere, nowhere
I know you've been around, I feel you in and out
How are you? Do you sleep? Are you with me?
We used to be unspoken
Now everything is broken, I'm a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son, oh
You're a good son
Oh, you're a good son

Arlanda, hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can vibe out for tonight
Stepping outside for a light
No coke and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know 'bout photos
Let's go though
How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
That's why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
The coldest dude who can't hold his Goose 
"I'ma walk out; wanna walk too?"
What about dude?
"Fuck him, I just really wanna feel something"
It took me like, five minutes to figure out
What the voices those were, on the phone
But I figured it out...
Is it real 'cause you're online?
Is it real 'cause you're online?
Is it real 'cause you're online?
Is it real  line?
I'm a freaky bitch
I am five foot eight, 390
And I am a freaky bitch
Heathen, it's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict
Craftmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie, nevertheless
I got that fresh like it was Crest, grind 'cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous, Lost God, never pray
Forgotten us, lost love, never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and finish it
Kinison said if you gon' miss Heaven
Why do it by two inches? Old money and new bitches
Old money and new bitches
Getting next level in a hotel
Ain’t shit that we don’t need, nigga, oh wellOooohh 
Fuck outta here dog  wassup, wassup
Don't, don't try to jump me
Don't try to jump me, fool
You got it, I ain't even wanna fight homies
You got it, cuz 
You got his-
Worldstar before rap, you already know that
So Fresh Prince, they about to bring the show back
Listening to Kilo, weekend cost a kilo
Hair so long, I'm about to bring the fro back
Phone call gotta say "Moshi Moshi" 
Girlfriend actin' all wishy-washy 
It's your birthday, make it earthquake
Fell in love with a nigga like a mermaid
 That's a first date, uhh
Nobody think about it, worst case, uhh
Best case, we the front page, uhh
10K on the first day, uhh
Yeah, mothafucka, take your phone out
To record this, ain't nobody can ignore this
I'm more or less a moral-less individual
Making movies with criminals, tryin' to get them residuals
When it all go crazy
When I hear that action, I'ma be Scorsese
My nigga, hold it horizontal man, be a professional
Damn my nigga, be a professional, what you doing man?
Get up, get up
Get the man right here 
Worldstar!
Worldstar!  Worldstar! 
Worldstar! Worldstar! 
My girl ain't bad, she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?
She on Hollywood and Vine, thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk 
But I saw through it like a wet shirt 
Drive slow 'cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop, when I heard shots
Watching dude drop from a Glock at a—
Ohhh, Worldstar!
Let me flash on 'em, we all big brother now
Lil' sis, let her run around
Money talking, you know the sound 
Money counter  AK 
Cell phone 
Yo, bro man, check out that video I just sent you, man
This shit is hilarious, man, it's like this kid, man, he got like sh-
He got like hit on the side of the head, man, he's like freakin' out
Like, heh, it's like he think he completely lost blood and shit
Hahahah, it's hilarious, man...
We don't wanna be on 
And all I wanna be is a 
We don't wanna be on 
And all I wanna be is a 
We don't wanna be on 
And all I wanna be is a-I'm fly
Man made the web, you don't need a name 
Man made of faults, I ain't too ashamed
Every thought I had, put it in a box 
Everybody see it just before the cops
Trolling, trolling, trolling these niggas
Rick Rolling these niggas, they mad cause they don't know any better
"Hold up, it's the kid—quick, tell him he can't sit with us!"
Fuck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity
Real deep, hope they dig a nigga 'fore they bury me
Even though we were told to go where they wouldn't go
Hella slow, that's that dial up, watch it pile up, fly
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer

Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer

Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha—
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean, where's the line between Donny-G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re-up
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed
The Sauza so malo 
Then she said, "You need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That Camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song."
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone—Now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden, this burden hurting, they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and had a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying, "Go hard"
Making dope, it's a trap; Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out; "It's the best," no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make him believe in himself, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, killing myself, no one's ever been this lost
I just get the information, retweet it or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who is this? Don't do it, where are you?
Who is this? Who is this) I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he move with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make her dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces of shit for breakfast
Funny, the day you born, that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversatin'
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
Plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talk in the evening, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas take her props, like a musical, live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams, on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her, "I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help"
She text me, "How you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?"
I mean she right though, .45 like a lightbulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took Chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass: "You see what these labels do to me?"
Text said, "I'm wet"; I said, "Hold up, wait a minute"
H2O plus my D, that's my hood, I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gon' reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish, but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit, eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
"Life: The Biggest Troll", but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up
You're here now
You have to help me
You have to help me
I need you—you have to help me
You have to help me
You have to help me
Please help me
Please help me
Please, please help me
Please—All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh
So CG, but a nigga stay real though
I'm fly, I'm ill, I'm runnin' shit
3-points, field goal
Rappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell
Cause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian, bail
Yeah, they starin' at me jealous 'cause I do shows bigger
But your looks don't help like an old gold digger
Uncool, but lyrically I'm a stone cold killer
So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut niggas
Yeah, now that's the line of the century
Niggas missed it, too busy, they lyin' 'bout penitentiary
Man, you ain't been there, nigga you been scared
And I'm still livin' single like Synclaire
Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate
When I wasn’t white enough to use your pool when I was eight
Stone Mountain, you raised me well
I’m stared at by Confederates, but hard as hell
Tight jeans, penny loafers, but I still drink a fo' dime
Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides
I’m just a kid who blowin' up with my father’s name
And every black "You're not black enough"
Is a white "you're all the same"
Mm Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes
'Cause it's Oreos, Twinkies, coconuts, delicious
How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?
I said, "I want a full house"
They said, "You got it, dude"
All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though 
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh
Holla, holla, holla, holla at your boy
Like your dad when he's pissed off
Got flow, I could make a cripple crip walk
Niggas' breath stank, all they do is shit talk
People want a real man, I made 'em wait this long
Maybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'
And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins
How'd it happen? Honesty did it
See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit
Yeah, I bodied the limits and I deaded them fakers
Motherfuck if you hate it, cremated them haters
So, my studio be a funeral
Yeah, this is our year, oh you didn't know?
Uh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den
Man I'm Hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead
On stage wit' my family in front of me
I am what I am: everything I wanna be
All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh oh
This is on a bus back from camp
I’m thirteen and so are you
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
I hadn’t met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble
It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you
And we’re still at camp as long as we’re on the bus
And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
We’re still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles
I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
But I don’t know if you do or don’t more-than-like me
You’ve never said, so I haven’t been saying anything all summer
Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
A girl who’s smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh
Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her
Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
Back in the real world we don’t go to the same school
And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
We won’t go to the same high school
So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something
And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
The sun’s gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep
We’re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
That looks like a kid we know
And then I’m like, “Can I tell you something?”
And all of a sudden I’m telling you
And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
And your face is there and gone and there and gone
As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
And there’s no expression on it
And I think just after a point I’m just talking to lengthen the time
Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet
And regrettably I end up using the word “destiny”
I don’t remember in what context. Doesn’t really matter
Before long I’m out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay”
I don’t know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive
And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
But there’s nowhere to go because we’re on a bus
So I pretend like I’m asleep and before long, I really am
I wake up, the bus isn’t moving anymore
The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
I turn and you’re not there
Then again a lot of kids aren’t in their seats anymore
We’re parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad’s car by now
Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
Just as one of them reaches my row
It used to be our row, on our way off
It’s Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
After throwing rocks at my head
Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
She stops and looks down at me
And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can’t really see her face
But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”
Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
And then she turns and leads them off the bus
I didn’t know you were friends with them
I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over
So is summer, even though there’s two weeks until school starts
This isn’t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
This is a story about how I learned something and I’m not saying this thing is true or not
I’m just saying it’s what I learned
I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always
Everybody can’t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them
But this means there isn’t a place in my life for you or someone like you
Is it sad? Sure. But it’s a sadness I chose
I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit
But that’s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus
I still haven’tYou can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feel like summer
I feel like summer
I feel like summer
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
I feel like summer
She feel like summer
This feel like summer
I feel like summer
Seven billion souls that move around the sun
Rolling faster, fast and not a chance to slow down
Slow down
Men who made machines that want what they decide
Parents tryna tell their children please slow down
Slow down
I know
Oh, I know you know that pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feels like summer
I feel like summer
I feel like summer
Every day gets hotter than the one before
Running out of water, it's about to go down
Go down
Air that kill the bees that we depend upon
Birds were made for singing
Waking up to no sound
No sound
I know
Oh, I know you know my pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we change
I really thought this world could change
But it seems like the same
I know
Oh, my mind is still the same
I'm hoping that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we changeBaby, you're the baddest

I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway
A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on the West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different
Right, that’s why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you

We in love and started dating at your art school
'Cause either way we both lying more than half of the time
Except for when I’m home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other, I'm taking you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
Yellow-911-Persian girl-in-the-back car
But me writin' a verse would be the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats
Watching lames handle they fame, they bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Analling anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding, stop
Girl cryin' on Ludlow, she still look good though
Love is Eastside, who are you to hate?
Movie ass; not a 10, but a super 8
You ain't see me at the show? I was super great

And I'm tryin' to say I'm a piece of shit
Believe in this, I'm tellin' you
'Cause we barely knew what we had
I'm not that bad, the fun we had
Ooh
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and uh

Love me better, kiss me back, listen more, oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Yeah, no, no, no
Face down in the brown grass
Shame shame on my brown ass
Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do?
What you gon' do? Like, "I can't remember"
Shots fired, rewind, please, girl, be mine
Email denied, talk to me baby
Before I go crazy, might do it maybe
We were so Jay Z, Beyonce, my aunt say "keep the sex game picante"
The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
To make me try and forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds, man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man, it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla
You can hang with homie on the low
But your boy so weak like a week ago
But we ain't speaking though
We ain't speaking, we ain't speaking though
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you 
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you 
Love me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh 
Love me better, kiss me back, listen -
The attitude
The attitude
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
We were never friends
And I hope you understand now
But I miss them
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
Oh no no no
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
And I hope you understand
 I hope you understand
'Cause everywhere I go
Everything I see
I just hope you understand"I had a dream
I had a dream I was flying over all of us
There were so many pretty people, so many pretty faces
I talked to some birds, I fell in love again
And none of this ever ended
Everything just kept going, and going, and going
And even when you laughed, you cried
And even when you were sad, you were really happy
Cause you were here, and I got to meet every star
Every planet, everything that made me
And we all kissed, and became the same
We became the same, we became the same."
Who would have thought this? We almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness, it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition, keep 'em off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been
We are all cold water
Why try at all? Why bother?
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Who would have dreamed this? You couldn't mean this
It would be some type of meanness to where you are
'Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know
We are all night's fallen
Why try at all? Dark calling
So we're left alone, no one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones, as I travel on
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
So we're left alone, no one left to call upon
Be still my broken bones, as I travel on
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Cold wa-
Cold wa-Alright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk-About-His-Dick-Again
Nerdy-ass black kid, whatever, man, I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, "What is this nigga doin? Rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot, man, he think that we feel that"
Or "I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about"
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's? Nigga

"Man, fuck you nigga...fuck you nigga!"
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the Titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
"Super Bass," super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that payback, comin' on that mace took

You can't live your life on a bus...
EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY
A white bus opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming. After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, A LITTLE BOY steps off. He's walking slow and somber
All the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end
A chauffeur  stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy
       CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is
He holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo
The Boy's FATHER  is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off
The Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours
       FATHER: How was camp?
The Boy "shrugs"
       FATHER : You make any friends?
       THE BOY: No
The father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh
       FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight
       THE BOY: Frito pie
       FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-
       THE BOY : It's Frito pie
Silence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window
EXT. MANSION - DAY
The Chauffeur helps Father out the car. The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home. The Mansion is dope. Very Big, and not gaudy. It looks classic
INT. MANSION - DAY
An infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs. You can see all of this from the foyer, which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it. The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care
The Father's phone rings:
       FATHER: Hello
       PHONE VOICE: Hello, this is the Califax collection-
Father hangs up. His cell phone goes off
The Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out
INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
The Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway. He kicks off his shoes. They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground. We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years. Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice
The Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics
He starts checking his mail. His friend "FAM" sent him something that says "this is you" with a link. The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video
He goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as "VERY HOTTTTTTT". The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying
"This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future! " is the top comment
The Boy stares. Then types "fuck u niggers" in the comments
He waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart
He refreshes the page. People immediately respond with "Fuck U", "You wouldn't say that to my face faggot", and "LMFAO crackers b crazy"
The Boy smiles
...bec a use the in t e  rnet15 YEARS LATER**************
INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING
The room is an elegant mess. There's shit everywhere, but everything has its place. Classic furniture; someone with old money would invest in, is used for the bed, desk, desk chair. You can see from where most of the trash accumulates that the occupant spends most of his time on the computer
There is a pile of stacked and flattened gummy bear wrappers by the desk. There's a picture of The Boy and his father on the boy's desk, along with a flash drive that has "hackz" written on it. A small vaporizer charges and glows green on the edge. There's a half ounce of weed in a plastic bag to the left of the laptop on the desk
There's a black and white Bill Withers poster, a Gorillaz "Demon Days" poster, and a "Black Dynamite" poster. All framed. Stacks of records are placed on a shelf lining the wall. There are some old 70's soul records by a record player on the shelf. Norman Connors "You Are My Starship" is the album on top of the others
Little hills of dirty clothes grow up the walls from the floor. Same pile of shoes is there. Wall with same dirty spot. The closet is filled with white shirts and flower shorts. There's one very old and tattered Shearling coat that hangs to the right
The Boy  is sprawled out on his bed, no shirt and flower shorts. He opens one eye as very faint, dark orange sunlight from the blinds cut his face. He gets up
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Buddha statue again. There's empty old beer and Pellegrino bottles on the bar. The entire back of the living room wall is glass. The boy walks briskly to the kitchen
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
The kitchen is a slight mess. Things left out. S'mores makings left out. The marshmallows are hard as stones. The boy goes into the cabinet and pulls out a pop tart. He takes out a pop tart and throws it in the microwave, wrapper still on . He starts the microwave and begins texting someone. The microwave is okay for about 5 seconds, then blue sparks start to pop inside. He turns off the microwave, opens it, grabs the pop tart and tosses it on a plate
EXT. BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING
The Boy walks onto the little island in the middle of the infinity pool lining the oceans and mountains in the background. The mountains are surrounded by clouds. They're literally above the clouds. It's probably raining down there. There's an orchard with lemon and plums to the west of the wall outside, and a green statue of a golfer further in. Bunnies jump on the lawn in the background
The boy sits under a sun umbrella, opens the pop tart and starts to eat it. He looks off with his face flat. He gets a text message:
       FAM: when u wanna paddle out? 
       The Boy texts back: pick me up
CUT TO:
EXT. MANSION FRONT DRIVEWAY - MORNING
An old, red  Mazda rolls up to the front of the mansion and sputters to a stop. FAM, steps out of the car. Daps up
       FAM: Let's take one of yours
       THE BOY: Nah
       FAM: Really, mane? You want us to drive around in my car? I don't think it'll make it, honestly. It broke down at my mom's. Plus... it looks like my car
       THE BOY: Right. It's inconspicuous
       FAM: My nigga, who are you hiding from? It's not stuttin. It's your car. Why do you even care?
"...why do you even care?"
       THE BOY: Aight
INT. GARAGE - MORNING
The garage door rises to reveal Fam and The Boy's silhouette. Five cars are in the garage. There's a Tesla Model S, Silver 911, some car no one's ever seen, a Tahoe and some car under a tarp. Looks like it could be an Aston Martin. Fam smiles
       FAM : That one-
       THE BOY: No
       THE BOY: The Bimmer
We didn't even see this one. It's in the far corner of the garage. It's a nice car. Older, but nice and sleek. Understated, to some. Its black paint is chipping in the front. Fam shakes his head
       FAM: Nah...nah
They get in the 911
CUT TO:
EXT. SANTA MONICA CONDOS - DAY
The 911 pulls up to a nice condo complex. Fam honks the horn for a while. Like a jerk
       SOMEONE FROM A WINDOW: I work nights, dickhead!
       FAM: I know. Fuck me, right?
Fam honks more
The Boy checks his Twitter feed. Twitter name "You Are Unimportant - @thegoldmolar" You can see from his feed he just trolls all the time. Politicians, athletes, entertainers, etc. His favorite was simply re-tweeting something someone says. When it was dumb enough to just re-tweet, that was his favorite. He'd gotten a lot of followers that way. Written an article once for a blog. Got more followers. He started posting videos of homeless people and fights
He was looking for something to retweet on his time-line. People say dumb shit all the time...
...someone tweeted "roscoe's wetsuit"
"...what's that?"
The Boy drops "roscoe's wetsuit" into Google. A Yahoo answer comes up for it. The answer to "what is roscoe's wetsuit?" is..."roscoe's wetsuit". Hilarious
SWANK, STEVE, MARCUS , and AJ  walk out of the condo. They have longboards with them and they're eating candy. They stop in their tracks when they see the 911
       SWANK : How we supposed to get these in there?
       FAM: You guys take your car
       STEVE: What about your boards? Where are they?
       FAM: Can we borrow some?
They all make a face
       SWANK: We need a bigger car then. I'ma drive to your house and get the Tahoe
       THE BOY: Come on, guys. This is taking forever
       AJ: Where we going?
       FAM: Dockweiler
       MARCUS: I swam into a diaper last time
       FAM: I'm GRIMEY. I ONLY SWIM IN DIRTY WATERS! YOU KNOW THIS!
       SOMEONE AGAIN: Shut the fuck up!
Fam honks the horn
       SWANK: I'm drivin that Porsche the way back. I know that shit
Swank and Steve walk toward their car parked on the street
       THE BOY: What's "roscoe's wetsuit" mean?
       FAM: I don't know
They drive off
EXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - DAY
The guys carry the boards through the sand to ocean, making a strange pattern behind them
They setup camp and start changing on the beach
       MARCUS: I thought someone was bringing girls
       THE BOY: No one wants to get up this early
       MARCUS: Did you ask white girls?
       THE BOY: I asked every girl
       FAM: You a lie. You didn't ask anybody. You don't leave the house
       STEVE: Why white girls?
       MARCUS: Cause no one is getting up at 6AM to go into the freezing, dirty ass ocean, fuck up their hair-
At that moment, they all notice a girl sitting on her board in the ocean. Waiting for a wave she looks behind her. She is black
       MARCUS : See? This is what I mean about Donnie Darko happening to me
A plane flies low overhead. 
       MARCUS  
It's gonna crush me
       SWANK : It's like seeing a mermaid
       STEVE: Maybe it's a manatee
       MARCUS : I'ma flirt
Marcus runs to the water with his board. They all follow
EXT. OCEAN - MORNING
Marcus swims up to the girl on his board
       MARCUS: Sup
       GIRL: Hi
       MARCUS: I'm Marcus
       SASHA: Sasha
       MARCUS: It's lookin alright today
       SASHA : Yeah. It's the only reason I'm out here
       MARCUS: Oh, you're Australian  You ever seen "Kangaroo Jack"?
       SASHA : Yeah
       MARCUS: Classic
       SASHA: ...wha?
       MARCUS : It's a fucking classic
Silence. Sasha is weirded out. All the guys, except The Boy, swim up
       STEVE : Hi. Did Marcus ruin it already?
       SASHA: Yes
Steve splashes Marcus
Swank takes a plastic bag with four blunts in it. He takes one out. He lights up a blunt. Talks with it hanging in his mouth
       SWANK: How long you been surfing?
       SASHA: Ten years. You?
       SWANK: Bouta month
AJ: Cops don't come out here. It's a good place to smoke. You want some?
He passes it. She takes a hit
       SWANK: What you doin tonight?
       SASHA: My friend's birthday in Santa Monica
       MARCUS: Yo, we're right around close. We're having a party tonight in a mansion. You should come. And if your friend's a girl or a guy who has weed, they should come too
       AJ: I'm Djing. I start off with Jodeci, then the switch over to 90's rap using "Dream Lover" to transition, play ACTUAL ATLANTA TRAP for an hour, hour and a half. Then motown, soul, and house. Girls. Go. Crazy
       SASHA: What's your DJ name?
       AJ: Twercules. no "DJ". Just Twercules. I got a tumblr where I post my mixes. It's getting pretty popular. I don't know. You sing? Model? Act?
       SASHA: I'ma go in
Sasha starts paddling and catches a wave into the beach
       AJ: I shouldn't have said "bitches"
       MARCUS : ...you didn't
AJ thinks on this. This is probably saying more about him than he realizes
EXT. BEACH - MORNING
Sasha carries her board onto the beach. The Boy is sitting there
       SASHA: You goin in?
       THE BOY: Don't know yet
       SASHA: Then why'd you put on your wetsuit?
...roscoe's wetsuit
       THE BOY: Everyone else was
       SASHA: That's an awful reason
She starts walking
       THE BOY: You should come to the party. It'll be fun.  They invited you, right?
       SASHA: Where is it?
       THE BOY: . Text me 
       SASHA: I'll remember. I'll bring some friends
She walks off
Later that day:
**************
EXT. I-10 - EVENING
The guys drive down the highway eating In-N-Out. Head nods all around. Swank is now driving the Porsche. Crazily. Fam is with The Boy and the rest of the guys in the other car. Marcus drops his animal style fries on the floor
       MARCUS: Fuck
       FAM: You see you fuckin up this car?
       THE BOY: It's fine
       FAM: He's driving crazy.  And he's textin me
The text says: R E C K L E S S
       FAM : This nigga's so lame
The Boy sees a tweet of the lead singer of a boy band tweet "follow your heart and  all who cross your path!". The Boy retweets it with a 
       FAM : I gotta stop somewhere first
CUT TO:
EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
Fam pulls outside of a club. Lots of people are trying to get in. He and The Boy get out and walk to the bouncer, their friend CHEESE. Fam and Cheese dap. The Boy stands on the side next to a line of people trying get in VIP. They look at each other. He is not dressed appropriately to get in
Fam and Cheese do that handshake thing they do. Fam walks in
Some guys in a black SUV rolls by and yell at the dude next to The Boy
       MAN IN CAR: Dont let me catch you out here Jay! Don't let me catch you!
The Boy watches this for a second. He looks down for a moment...
Someone has spray painted "roscoe's wetsuit" on the sidewalk. He stares at it
       MAN IN CAR : I got yours, muthafucka!
The Boy snaps out of it. Then takes out his phone and starts recording the fight. Fam walks out and sees the fight in action
       JAY : You scared, bitch! That's why you scared!
       MAN IN CAR: I got something for yo ho-ass my nigga!
POP. POP
..what's happening?
Jay is bleeding from his stomach. The Boy is seeing this through his phone. It takes a moment for him to realize-
POP. POP
...run. now
Fam is already running. Everyone in the line is screaming and running. The Boy runs
       COP: Drop your weapon!
 POP.POP.POP
Runs to the side of the building. The SUV that was firing slows down. The driver is dead. Car horn blares as the car slows to a stop, mixing with girls crying and "oh shit!" and "fuck". Jay is very close to dead. The blood on the sidewalk is almost black. A street sign  is reflected in the dark blood. He turns to The Boy, looks around. He knows what's happening. He's leaving
That was the end. He'll never read this sentence. Or any sentence. He ended earlier. Before this sentence. As far as he knows, before any sentence. He's back to his/the natural state
The Boy felt something
It's funny, cause this dude is dead. There really isn't a connection...it's more him seeing himself for the first time since-
       SOME NIGGA: Damnnnnn.....!
       HIS FRIEND: WORLDSTAR!
The Boy's phone rings:
       THE BOY: Yeah
       FAM: Get in the car
The Boy turns and sees the car rolling up to the alley he's hiding in. The Boy runs up and jumps in. They speed off
INT. CAR - NIGHT
       FAM: That shit was NUTS!
       STEVE: I knew something was about to happen. I knew it
       MARCUS: Donnie Darko. I'm tellin you
The Boy is looking at the footage on his phone. He's got a death on video. It's looped. Over and over
The Boy touches his shearling coat...there's a hole in it. Bullet hole? He puts his finger through...
...i shouldn't be 
He looks at Fam and Steve. They're talking
       MARCUS : Bitches high heels everywhere! They ran out they shoes, cuh
       FAM: BAP! BAP! BAP! Oooow. That nigga lit up
The Boy just keeps watching the video
       FAM: Yo. You got it on video?
       THE BOY: Yeah
       FAM: Wow...you caught the end of his journey on video. That's dope.  We gotta pic up Doc from the jazz club
INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
Fam and The Boy Stand in the back. Doc is on stage playing saxophone with a band. He's doing a solo
       THE BOY: Does it weird you out that you almost died today?
       FAM: Not really. I'm not trippin on death
       THE BOY: I'm not trippin. I'm just sayin, if you think about it, there's no reason for us to be here
       FAM: Doc be hanging with the weirdest people. Look at these niggas. They all look like James Blake. Is that who likes Jazz now?
       THE BOY: I was thinking about it and I can't offer anyone anything. Like, my job is tweeting at people. That's my job
       FAM: That's not your job. You do it cause it's funny. You're rich. We don't have to do anything
       THE BOY: Yeah. Isn't that sad?
       FAM: Sad? We are making moves. What about that line me and Swank are gonna start selling?
       THE BOY: All we did was print shirts for ourselves. Who else is buying that shit? And the whole reason we wanted to make shirts is cause Tre made some and they were dope
       FAM: I don't know what to tell you. We are doing dope shit. We are making moves. We can do whatever we want-
       THE BOY: But none of it matters cause we're doing it for ourselves! We're just jerking off for each other. No one in the future's gonna give a shit I made a shirt once
       FAM: Then don't make a shirt, my nigga
       JAMES BLAKEY LOOKING DUDE: Shhh!
The Boy fiddles with the hole in his jacket
INT. MANSION - NIGHT
All the guys walk in with plastic bags from the grocery store. They have blue cups, alcohol, s'more fixings, and gummy bears
If I was the director, I'd have everyone walk in in slow motion into the house with "Nosetalgia" by Pusha T playing
Walking into bedrooms. Opening drawers. Pulling out bags of weed
CUT TO:
AJ walks into his large closet. Pulls out a bowl. There are some prescription bottles there too
CUT TO:
A naked Marcus steps out of the shower and goes in his closet and pulls out some condoms
CUT TO:
Fam is meditating in the center of his bed. He's floating off the bed by about 4 inches

Words that I made up, you say my name like-
Words that I made up, you say my name like-Oh, we gon' have a party
All my friends will be there
We drink all the vodka
There's music everywhere
Now wait a minute 
Do you like to party?
Cause if you don't 
Don't come over here
We got smoking, Blue Dream
Drinking, cocaine, fucking
I wanna show you what it is, ohh
Thought I was done but that wasn't the case
Got a new stack that I threw in your face
Got a new girl and she look Mila Kunis
Infinity pool, and a statue that's Buddhist
Got bottles and bottles and bottles of Grino
Saw I was rich, now they fucking with 'Bino
Brown leather bag, the vacation Messina
The boat in the harbor, I rule the marina
10K for the drinks, now they say I'm insane
It's been that for a minute, now Hedi Slimane
I been black, lucrative, since Danity Kane
Who came back for a minute, now everything changed
High as a kite, lime in the light
Y'all niggas might whine every night
I ain't invite all these people to my mothafuckin' house
"Get the fuck out of my house!"
Yo, chill—
Hey, chill, man!See, now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See, now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day and call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me 
That "A" on my chest like adultery 
That "A" on my chest, put your fist up 
That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk
Alvin, Theodore
Breathe in, breathe out, mi amor
Breathe in, breathe out, nevermind
It was time, number nine, l-l-lies
Feline with a deathwish
Eat right didn't help shit
No name on the guest list
Hold on, we were destined
See, now I don’t wanna see an era  an era  an era
See, now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it’s the last night 
Maybe it’s the last night 
Maybe it’s the last night 
Maybe it’s the last night 
Maybe it's the last night
All that I have
All I don't have's the future
Take on my soul
All night
Yeah, break free from all of the insides
The godless denied us
But we don't give a damn 'bout the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the truth, then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed never live long
Live and die by the line "Never know fear"
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress only thing that'll last 
3005, the year that we fear only God will survive
To be alone is alive
See, now I don’t wanna see an era, an era, an era
See, now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
See, now I don’t wanna see an era, an era, an era
See, now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night

Rainbows, sunshine, go
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine, yeah
Rainbows, sunshine
I thought I told you 'bout it 
You don't leave home without it 
She on my back about it 
And all the time 
Oh oh, yeah 
How could you ever question? They know better to mention
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention
The who, what, why and where, they sport the flyest pairs
She got the nicest hair and she know life is better with this nigga
It's crazy how the world look different
It's crazy how the girls look different
The colors and the sounds so vivid
You never catch your boy po-pimpin'
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right
But as long as I look fly by prom night—go
Rainbows  sunshine
Rainbows  sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine, yeah
Rainbows, sunshine
Jhene Aiko's angelic harmonizing
He slangs, his yay, through the corridors
Every day, 20K, yep, at the very least for sure
And they say there's no way
I should stay with someone like you, but I tell them no
There's no way I could stray
Gotta stay with someone like you
'Cause I know one day
You could take me away, far away
I know you could pay
All the money you made, there'll be plenty of sunshine
I never worry 'bout it 
I have my nigga count it 
No, no 
She's dressed up in gold 
I'm out of time 
Oh, no, no, no 
I'm out of time, oh no no
Out of time, oooh
I'm out of time, out of time
La-la-la, la-la-la What the fuck do y’all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the "real niggas" I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude’s for real or not
I’m not trying to come hard, I’m trying to come me
That’s why these older songs that I used to make I’d release free
What’s the point of rap if you can’t be yourself, huh?
That’s why I come first like my cell phone
I’m a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it’s dumb, that’s the fucking reason I’m doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
‘Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend’s baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she’s sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That’s not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
’Cause I ain’t Mumford, I ain’t tryin’ to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain’t the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion!
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
“Baby, I’m on the edge”
She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m on the edge”
She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m on the edge”
She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m on edge”
Said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
Am I serious? I don’t even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain’t trying, I’m doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R’s a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, “I’d get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man”
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain’t Curren$y, but if there ain’t money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loves to text me Psalm verses
She don’t look at me like I’m the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
And I don’t want them missing a son like Bon’s last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I’m grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with no I.D. and No I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
We need to find
We need to findYuh, ahehe
Aye, it's- this is royalty, right?
Yeah, we royalty, you ain't even know that?
You gotta use the royal "we" around us
It's royalty
Who the fuck Gambino? 
This nigga on yo' TiVo? 
My hotel cost a kilo, we bankin' like a free throw 
Fuck y'all, we A-Team, y'all plan B like Walgreens
Cop that shit and paint it black, niggas want they summer back?
Ha-ha, no way , hublots, Dolce
Beans in my hand, girl in the car
She still with her man, but she seein' me tomorrow 
Homegirl on that Master P, watch us ball like referees 
Unnecessary roughness? We just tryna function 
Used to sport them Filas 'cause my cousin pack them heaters
We don't wife 'em like Khalifa 
We just party then we leave 'em
Tell 'em that we hittin', we don't really see 'em
My girl look best when she only wear a fitted
Q and 'Bino in the house and you niggas in the Senate
Get it?
Four thou' on my fit, that's unnecessary
Skiing in Japan, that's unnecessary
Molly on my rider, that's unnecessary
'Bino spit the fire, that ain't even necessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
Roll out on a plane, that's unnecessary
'Tussin and champagne, nigga, that ain't even necessary
Yo, they said don’t buy the belt and I got it 
They said don’t get the Rollie and I bought it, uh 
Nigga, I’m ballin' 
My fuckin' mixtape can get you through college 
Gettin' them dollars 
Showin' my pearly white teeth, I'm a nigga that’s flawless 
Came a long way from dumpin' out Impalas 
Same gun and pants, different ski mask from coppers
All of this copper
Knock knock, who could it be? Niggas know I got it on lock 
Yawk, yawk 
Bitch rappers better move ‘fore them niggas get dropped
 Uh, uh 
Mr. Flop boy, you got your label hot 
I’m the hardest out, you's a table cloth 
Unnecessary ballin', I was carted off, uh
Been fucking with my side bitch so much
My main bitch can’t stand it 
Hunnid racks in three months, man this shit is outstanding, uh
Seen a dollar go to stupid racks, billion, trillion
Nigga, that’s what I call building
‘Bino what it do? Let’s go half on a million
Bathroom DVR, that’s unnecessary 
Pushin' in that bulletproof, that’s unnecessary 
Stuntin' in the mall, that’s unnecessary 
Condo on my arm, that ain't even necessary
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary 
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary 
Ibiza for a day, that’s unnecessary 
Show's a hundred K , nigga, that ain’t even necessary
Bl-bl-bla-black Lip Bastard, actual natural disaster
I did a song about DMT, Soulja Boy did one right after-er-er-er
3 eyes, these guys ain’t seein' me
No radio showed up over B.o.B
G-O-D MC, I’m the devil with angel wings
Pilot Talk, currency , stole the show, burglary 
I love that flow but I got more 
Open condoms in condos 
Open bottles of Moet 
White with white girls in Eugene 
We used to call hoes on 3-way 
And take 'em out to the movies 
And now we just do it our way 
She drivin' stick in the driveway 
Just popped a molly with Miley 
She do shrooms every blue moon 
Hundred million trillion motherfuckin' racks, nigga 
Pinot Grigio the lean’ll go in that, nigga 
Now that's unnecessary, been a legend since elementary
Ayo, Bino, tell these niggas I ain't no joke
She don't need speak, she ain't giving no throat
You are under my control, suspend the L's but I'm on a roll
Grade A, honor roll, mayday, Soul!Uh uh
Yeah we gon' get it
Yeah
Uh uh
Oh no no no
We can go together
It doesn't really matter
We can get there
We can do it if we try
You know that I love you
Put no one else above you
We can get there
We can do it if we try
Young Bino in the house like an B&E
Why I'm looking so fly, I'm just being me
Moved up, weed in my girl clutch
White girls so twelve, never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god
She need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down, then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique
There's a lot of us
They talk shit but nobody else on top of us
Got popular, this the real shit
Get ... in the face with a full clip
Get ... in the aim, niggas don't slip
Then get ... with a case just for sellin' it
I know them gorillas, I hang with them killers
They paint 'em as villains
When really they livin', we gotta ball
This is world war three, I'm the new Jay-Z
I ain't write shit down, I'ma steal that crown
I'ma do that thing
Girl, you sweeter than mango
How we cool and confident with hair like Django?
How we walk in the room and the girls they notice?
'Cause they know you bogus
I'm the man you noticed
And
We can go together
It doesn't really matter
We can get there
We can do it if we try
You know that I love you
Put no one else above you
We can get there
We can do it if we try
I'ma show you how to do this
It's easy when you
Let go, let go
Didn't mean to make you nervous
The booty lookin' retro retro
You can be the moon to me
And I can be your spotlight 
And if you think I'm ballin'
You shoulda seen me last night, last night
Fuck that, fuck ya'll and the po-po's
Down under, surfin' on the Gold Coast
I'm looking for the truth in a blunt
And I ain't got a home
Let's stunt
So baby if you feel like you wanna leave
I ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles
The game ain't easy
We both deserve a little bit of timeout
We can go together
It doesn't really matter
Oh
Yeah
'Kay, one, two, three, go!
Oh, hey
Oh, hey, ah
One more timeIt seems like they all want me to fail
But I’m not going back
Not going back, baby
Please tell me you don’t want me to fail
‘Cause I’m not going back
Not going back
I could've been a tragedy
That’s why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me
‘Cause they ain’t have the smarts or the heart
Ain’t you read the fucking book Things Fall Apart?
I was never gonna stay the same
All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kicking ass and taking names
Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
Calling me the new Will Smith, that’s Jaden
Calling me a faggot when I’m rapping, that’s hating
I need to slow down, what the fuck is y’all saying?
Step inside the party, y’all niggas is mood killers
My lifestyle simple: Live easy and Bruce Willis
I’m the boss, Michael Scott, y’all bitches is just Phyllis
Set the world on fire, y’all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?
That’s why these fucking emcees want their asses back
Don’t you know that I’m a rapist? Ask a track
Whiskey sipping, wanna drink the whole bottle
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
Fucking hate me, that’s what I’m used to
Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil
God damn, man, there’s gotta be a better way
Than pill-popping all these drugs so I can stay awake
Like I’m Jessie in this bitch, I’m so excited
There’s a party at the top, you ain’t invited
But it’s lame, and all the bitches is fake
You think about your old girl and how breaking up’s a mistake
Black dudes assume I’m closeted or kinda gay
White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey
IAmDonald is a full-time job
These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off
It seems like they all want me to fail
But I’m not going back
Not going back, baby
Please tell me you don’t want me to fail
‘Cause I’m not going back
Not going back
Dirty girls love my dick; they’re cockroaches
Jewish girls eat my meat, it’s not kosher
Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee
Got nothing against the sisters, I just don’t think they’re into me
I am not a thug, AKA: what they pretend to be
I am just myself, AKA: my worst enemy
Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fucking knife
I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight
It’s cool though, it’s all good
You want a dude who keep it real and stay hood
I’m sorry, babe, but I act me
I don’t "act black", whatever that be
I’m just happy these girls seem into me now
Yeah, they're looking for some In-N-Out, animal style
With this lettuce, cheese, bread—making sandwiches
That’s why you niggas fail like all of your parents’ marriages
Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
She said to write her something nice on the next track
But she cute, so I wrote her ass a whole rap
Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb
Believe me, it was bad, we’re better off, you’re welcome
I worked hard on that song like day and night
That whole song made this one verse, crazy, right?
I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that?
Like that bullshit, you talked before Culdesac
"I didn’t know he had it in him"
Couldn’t see me as Spider-Man, but now I’m spittin’ venom
Now you payin’ attention, pick your fucking face up
When I wanna be a superhero, I just wake up
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
I refuse to go back to not liking who I was because
Fake love, these fake dreams
These fake sounds
All the things that we felt
Your voice was screaming too loud
I know what you’re ready to be 
But it isn’t with me 
So I’m ready to leave you alone
I don’t really wanna fight like this
I don’t ever wanna lose your kiss
All I ever wanted was someone to hold onto
I just wanna be your girl
Everything you haven’t heard
Plus, I just wanna be with you
 With you
 With you
 I just wanna be with you
 With you
 With you, oh
Oh, ohI've been grindin' my whole life, nigga
I've been grindin' my whole life, Rosenberg
I've been grindin' my whole life, Fam
Yo, let me see, yo, uh
Stuntin' on the low so they feel better
Damn, why they hatin' on a real nigga?
East side Atlanta where they kill niggas
I was in a coma but I stayed with you
I'll be right by your side, radio play me that new 3005
Bino won't die, illest rapper alive
See what's up with Fredo when I'm out in the Chi
Murder everything I touch, but I don't know why
And he can get the business, your girlfriend love me
Turn it up, who is this? Shots at your fitted
Gra-ta-ta, are we not that fly?
Are we not young God, is this not black excellence?
I could lie to you people but my soul too sensitive
Gam-b, y'all ain't got shit on me, man I'm so fly, like XYZ
Threat to the throne, man, I'ma murder this
You are such a poser, you ain't ever heard of this
Shots at you fake boys walkin' 'round in turtlenecks
And a du-rag? Wanna be me so bad
And the hair so homeless, record labels want us
Bino well read, like Octobers
Hit me on my Snapchat, hit me on my Nextel Chirp
Run up on them boys, get murked
Nigga sit down, he can't stand me
Curly black hair, bright pink panties
Blush on the vanity, tanner with her ass out
We don't have to love each other, she just wanna cash out
Stone Mountain bitch, run it off a mixtape
This is for my niggas up in Onyx getting shitfaced
He just dropped a mixtape, she got so excited
Took her to a Clippers game and niggas ain't invited
Drugs on the rider, need to clean my act up
Man, I thought he was an actor
Thought he was a fuckin' joke, when I wrote them fuckin' notes
Everything I do is dope, I hope you niggas overdose
I hope you niggas hear the truth, so honest in my interviews
If Parker Lewis couldn't lose, I'm blackin' out at Tongue & Groove
Royalty, I run the crew, we them boys
Yo, I've been grindin' my whole life, nigga
Nah I'm talkin' 'bout?
I'm just sayin' I'm grindin' my whole life, nigga
Nah know I'm talkin' 'bout?
Yo, I got some more, I got some more, yeah, yeah
Let me see, Imma try and go in, uh, uhm
Mothafuckin' right, we the niggas huffin' OG
In the club tryna keep it lowkey
She was all on my D, then we fell out of it
Cause I'm never really there and she tired of it
Real nigga shit, real love, real pain, real intimate
These niggas so scared, I'm killin' it
These niggas so scared, I'm killin' it
So serious, gave the wrong young niggas money
They gave the wrong young niggas money
Gave the wrong young niggas money
Schoolin' these niggas, got so many zeros they think I'm a dummy
Unlike these other niggas, man I'm really from Atlanta
This dark-skinned art student with light-skinned advantage
I'm ahead of my time, online messiah
Who spits so much fire that you a God damned liar
If you say he ain't hot, numbers don't lie
Niggas do though, when they say he ain't cold
Niggas need to learn code, man I'm sick with the Python
Mothafucka, I'm ill, born just to die, that's the human curse
The world in my words, spit a universe
I know they hate a nigga down in Spin Mag
Worst album, best song, how you spin that?
The best part is that they love Chance
But our fans are the same, you should fuck with your man
And I wonder what they'd say if that EP drop
"His verse was wack, his verse was hot"
I'm on my jock cause I don't need these hoes
They're all the same so I don't need these clothes
Same white shirt with his nappy ass hair
Like "bitch do I look like I care?"
Nah, in the end they will notice that we've been God
I watched these niggas switch jerseys when your team lost
And yet it's bitch move nigga, make the show 6 figures
Then you fly to Kauai for a week off
And his girl's body lookin' like a centaur
They do what they can, I do what I want
Let's move it along, the point of this song
I think you doin' fine all the time, drop a fuckin' bomb, nigga Vietnam
On my mom with my hand to God
So my hand's on my fuckin' chest, but you didn't notice
Niggas hang around like we didn't notice
Niggas can't help me but they want a selfie
Cause their girl is a fan and they really love us?
Know behind closed doors
You fuck with the kid or you still not sure? Be a man about it
Don't talk your shit and shake hands about it
Be a man, I doubt it, I don't know
I've been grindin' my whole lifeYeah nigga, it's me again
I'm still around, I guess I win
You hear me in your sister's room like all the time
"Gambino Girl forever" on that bracelet that she bought online
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, "Hasta luego"
'Cause I'm takin' all your city like I'm Carmen Sandiego
I am smokin', I'm on fire
I am blazin', don't get hurt
To my white dudes, it's a concert
To my black nerds, this is church
From that NYU dorm to the Emory
Everyone hated me, I'm more hip-hop than you'll ever be
I'm bustin', bustin', bustin', I'm bustin' on these niggas, man
And nothin', nothin' nothin', n-nothin' is the same again
You lookin' dumb as hell man for ever sleepin' on him
Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin 'on him
Will he fail? Now that's the wrong conversation
Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, ha
 What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
 What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
New shit, you didn't know?
Black rock like a fuckin' LOST episode
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own
So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her
And the fly Rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water
And I'm lookin' at her butt, that's that 20/20 hindsight
My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson, 5 Mikes
Donald Glover, no relation
Always workin', no vacation
They couldn't feel me, no vocation
Murder verses the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom
I've wanted this since a three-year-old
I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole
Bein' me, that's somethin' that's so unusual
I've seen the future, and the future go, ah
 What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
 What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
New shit
Can't you hear me, baby?
Can't you hear me callin' out your name?
Can't you hear me, baby?
Ohh, can't you hear me callin' out your name?Turn on the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y’all to see this
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Know what I mean, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the—
Hollering at this Japanese girl, Asian mommy
But is it too soon for Japanese girls? Too tsunami?
Is it racist if I say she tastes like edamame?
Was I supposed to stay uncool? Please remind me
Yeah, it’s Cheezy, ho
I’m so cheesy, ho, my swag’s got high cholesterol
I know y’all girls, I met them all
You're her ex-man like Cannonball
I ain’t got shit to say to ya, I’m known for bad behavior
Look at me
Man, I went to the W from Double Tree
Makin’ out with girls who black and yellow like a bumblebee
Can I live up to all this hype they have for me? It’s hard to tell
But these girls I’m kissin’ chase the blues away like Gargamel
I’m back in the game, coach put me in
T-Pain flow, all I do is win
With a glass full of Macallan to mess me up
And the cash we can throw at them unless we fuck
Dopeness
After this I hit the highway
I’m headin’ west like I’m fuckin’ blowin’ Kanye
Read the fuckin’ news, Huey Lewis, nigga
You can’t go H.A.M, you’s a Jewish nigga
Donald Glover, you don’t have to call me "Childish"
Except for when I’m flirting with your half-Latino stylist
Photoshoot, beach house playin’ Beach House, free wireless
So I can post these pictures on my website of her smilin’
I kissed this girl I’ve liked since back when I was just a sophomore
But I’m afraid to text her “What the fuck it take so long for?!”
What the fuck has changed? Is it swagger? Is it money?
I still dress the fuckin’ same and my nose is still as ugly
As the day you fuckin’ met me
They tellin’ me I’m the rapper for these white kids
‘Cause black kids can’t possibly like the same shit
I wanna bring you back to the studio, try and get your number
These black girls with natural hair who keep up with their Tumblrs
I like it when you tweet me, you smell like baby lotion
I wanna suck your breasts and finger blast to Frank Ocean
Her pussy tastes like vanilla, tasty ho
Clown niggas then I kill ‘em, Gacy flow
It’s crazy how these labels and these blogs are on my dick
I’m Pryor in his last years: comedian who’s sick
Fuck, but I am sick, seriously, I don’t feel so good
‘Cause I don’t get sleep, and I’m always travelin’
And I don’t go home, and my friends don’t call
‘Cause I turned off my phone
I’ve made mistakes, I bumped my head
Inside of this girl, inside of my bed
Whatever, man, I’m just havin’ fun
I’m sorry that I fucked her but now you know that she’s not the one
I’m doin’ you a favor, like every time I rhyme or write a script or do a movie
There’s a million ways to shine, choose one
Instead of what you’re doing tonight
IAMDONALD, coming soon, we've got all of the lights
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y’all to see this
Turn on the lights in here, baby
Know what I mean, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the—Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay 
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay 
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Firefly
Skateboardin' down at Washington Square
Lookin' for quarters
Maybe afford a falafel for dinner, uh
I’m so broke man, scholarship apologin'
Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'
Girls like, "We love you, we go to LSU,"
"You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you!"
This rap stuff is magic
I used to get called "Oreo" and "faggot"
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
"Oh, you got a mixtape? That's fantastic!"
But everybody thought it was jokes though
They half right, the joke is
I got flow so don't act like
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be
I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he campy
I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante
Me and hip-hop, that black Sid and Nancy, let 'em know
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay 
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay 
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
Firefly
It's hard to make Hov the footsteps you followin'
Especially when your niggas look like Carlton
The pretty girls usin' skin so soft
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off
Nigga, you act too soft
Fuck you! I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows, cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
"Yeah, so, whatcha gonna do man?
You don't speak to the hood, man"
If I was given one chance I think I could, man
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And you's a fake fuck like a fleshlight
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet JAY-Z?
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', "You could tear this up!"
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be
Now everyone sing the chorus man, you do it so beautifully
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics
And I'm like, okay 
And when they hear us on the beat
All they wanna do is make hits
And I'm like, okay 
And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'

And if you're feelin' how I'm feelin'
How the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so highIf we were kids, I'd want to give
You everything that you would want
Those other boys, they give you toys
But all they wanna do is
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
I guess I'm fuckin' now, I'm gettin' used to it
It's cause I shine, and I ain't gotta use a crucifix
Fuck the fussin' and fightin' and arguin' to this and that
And, "Why you being mean to me Donald?"
I never text her back
I know it's coming quick, wishin' I could fast forward
Tell these nice girls they're the reason that I'm an asshole
Omega to alpha male, because of that dollar bill
When I worked the mail room, I ain't have a shot in hell
I called her ass for two months, ain't heard shit from her
These girls couldn't care less when ya chips under
The chips are up and on my shoulder, you heard me?
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it
The girls I tried to hit last year, I still might
Karma's a bitch who doesn't suck, but I still like
If we were kids, I'd have the black K-swiss and Reebok
If we were kids, I wouldn’t act like this, but we not
If we were kids, I'd wanna give you everything
That you would want
Those other boys, they give you toys
But all they wanna do is
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
You made a mistake
These dudes? Man, you bathin' in apes
Findin' you's like findin' Asians I hate
But they say I got a fetish, nah, I’m skippin' all of it
Black and white girls always come wit' a set of politics
That’s all that I was sayin', I’m a proud man
They wanna holler when they see your name on SoundScan
Her name Mercedes, but she push a brown Focus
And she’s doin' coke in front of me, but act like I don’t notice
There ain't breakage in that Trojan? She see what she wanna see
So I make her take Plan B in front of me
Women talk shit on men like all day
But it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways
They too busy stabbin' hoes like OJ
They too busy trappin' pros like Kobe
The only thing I put before me is "Do, re"
If you had told me the truth, we’d be ok
If we were kids, I'd want to give
You everything that you would want
Those other boys, they give you toys
But all they wanna do is
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all I want, keep up
Keep up with me, keep up
It’s alright, it’s okay
It’s alright, it’s okay, girl
It’s okayPickin' out my fro with my fist comb
I got a tab at the Stone baby, this long
My little brother was havin' a little trouble
I hope that he doesn't care that it's in this song
Koreatown lunchin', talkin' 'bout how to run things
He said Atlanta wanted somethin'
Waka, Jeezy, and Future got the streets locked down
Copycats making sure T.I.P. keep that crown
I'm fucking 'round with the truth, went to see The Roots
Quest brought me back on stage in a suit
I went hard 'cause niggas say that I'm soft
Even Black Thought thought I maimed it a little hard, I gotta be honest
Feelin' like the other stuff is kinda behind us
Makin' jokes here and there done got us some dollars
I'm tryna show the whole world what it is and it ain't a game
He said "Homie, stay the course, ain't shit changed
Weird night and everybody was tipsy
Hangin' out with Questlove reminiscin' 'bout Whitney
He like, "Man, we can't even make it to 50?!"
That reminds me, I sent a long text message to my mom and pop
I got the same speech when I left 30 Rock
My mom like, "Why you wanna leave a good job?"
My dad like, "Do your thing, boy, don't stop"
Shout out to my nigga Lud, shout out to my nigga Swank
For hangin' at the crib and telling me what you think
Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel is real
And never let these white people tell you how to feel
Never let anybody tell you how to feel
I wanted what they had back in the fourth grade
Family vacays, you know I did it all
Just to see my little sis by a waterfall
My great granddad bought his own freedom
Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm
So don't be alarmed, man, I'm royalty
Jam of the week, V103
No cosign, no bovine
More swag, pull back on the punchlines
Starvin', every track means lunch time
Huh, I'm a star, how could I not shine?
Fuck boys chase hype and scrat chicks
And niggas who stopped textin' after 1.6
DG Lover ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
D-Money ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
And what's a leader if he isn't reluctant?
Too bad for y'all, I'm blastin' off
I'm not Asher Roth, I don't sleep on my bread
Dick riders stay close, I might flash a ball
Sometimes, all this shit make a nigga feel guilty
I used to sleep with them roaches
Back of my mind though, I hope the show gets canceled
Maybe then I can focus
Hawaii touch down, go ahead baby, put your shades on
East Side! East Side to the gravestone!
Brown liquor, but my girl in Bed-Stuy
Nigga, you got Drive like a sale at Best Buy, uh
Hold up, hold up, we can do better
Put my voice on the track, man, that shit is much wetter
At the studio at 8 AM
Hit the booth then eat, nigga, we ain't them, nigga, we ain't them!
Drop a line, it's your Facebook status
Said that shit about a week ago, you still mad at us
If there's something on your chest, nigga, let it out
'Cause I'm the best, da-da-daOh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Oh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh
Yeah, uh
Why in the fuck these niggas
Try and hold me down, ohh
"You such a fuckin' lame!"
It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade
My mama said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down
Hit the office, stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found
Not bad for a family of foster child
Lookin' fly man, I'm flossin' now
But them niggas saw through me
"Are you serious? What is this?"
Took the jacket off third period, ellipsis
Listening to "Sky Is the Limit" on my Walkman
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can
Dope-boy swag, I always wanted that
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
But no love for the son of a commuter who was a radio head
And okay at them computers at the post office
It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
All my people need throat lozenge
My fear is dead, ambition drove the hearse
But niggas got me feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church
Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough
We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?
The black experience is black and serious
Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us
White kids get to wear whatever hat they want
When it comes to black kids one size fits all
Oh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Oh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh
We the baddest nigga
We the baddest nigga, yeah
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga, uh
We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga, uh
We the baddest nigga, uh, we the baddest nigga
The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's
The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
They only see you how they wanna see you
'Til you make them see you in some other way
I'm trippin' off the other day
'Cause God knows what these white kids sayin' dude
You're not not racist 'cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
Subtle racism, it's hard to pin it
'Cause you'd only understand if you were me for just a minute
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad
Mostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
If you're a father, you should stick around if you could
'Cause even if you're bad at it, you could Tiger Woods or MJ
We warriors, we all need senseis
Change everything that we've done so far
I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R
I mean just the way that we see each other
I won't stop until they say:
"James Franco is the white Donald Glover"
Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie, but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness
Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice
Aimin' for the throne, Jay and Ye said to watch that
They ask me what I'm doin', and I said I'm stealin' rock back
Nigga
Oh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Oh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, oh
Oh, I want it, yeah
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down, oh
Oh, you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down, ohUh
Someone made a mess in my account 
Someone bought a Patek in a panic 
Bode, Bentley addict, I go manic 
Hit the oochie-coochie 'til it's slanted, ooh
I'm gon' beat it up, ooh, lady
I'm gon' make your dreams come, baby
Ayy, you the one who talkin' all that trash 
Forty-five, I'll twenty-eight that ass 
You can set the snow on fire 
You smell like a peach papaya
She said, "Eat this psilocybin, I'ma be right back"
I'm like, "Aight" 
"Ayy, I don't know what psilocybin is" 
"This better not be no molly"
She just laughed and closed the door
Dark chocolate, sea salt
I took a bite
She said, "We gon' have a special night" 
I said, "Who you telling, girl? I know that"
Tracee Ellis with it when you throw back 
Girl, I see your 
Ooh, you're so divine 
And them panties came off 
I'ma give you some privacy 
Pictures with your stepsisters 
N. K. Jemisin with you, uh
Got the All About Love, on some bell hooks
Then I turned to a dirty look, uh 
Ayy, why your cat lookin' at me sideways?
"Sing to her"
I said, "Nah, I'll put on the radio though"
Lay back on my back , vibrate
My ex on some BS
She walked out the closet
Girl, never write a check I can't deposit
She said, "Boy, stop, let's go walkin'" 
"You wanna be outside for this"
We just talkin'
Dogpark looking like a Trader Joe's 
Papillon, mmh, thought you hated those
Other girls, uh, let they shady show
Every time we walk around
They say, "How she gonna hold him down?" No
They don't know what they missing
Most these niggas wanna run around with these SZAs 
I prefer to just stroll the park with this Chaka
Baby girl was just diggin' all in my pockets 
I was going hard 
We were holdin' hands, tried to make me understand 
Make girls fall in love, that's my , yes
Everybody's jealous I won't ease it with these colors
Ooh, I wanna see it in the moonlight
Yellow, red, orange robe, askin' for donation 
I'm not a tourist, nigga, this is not vacation 
Vibrate
Goddamn, man, this girl goin' crazy on my Motorola
She said, "Let me answer it" 
Then she'll know it's over 
Girl, you cancerous, you gon' ruin my life
Let me get this paperweight, then come be my wife
She just laughed and touched my face 
You don't understand what this is 
I ain't lookin' for another lifetime
Let's just stay here and enjoy the great design
Had the iceberg tucked in my waist 
Fuck an omelet, you can eat off my face 
I just thought that we were vibin'
You don't love her, then you lyin'
Come and go and you get tulips
Put a finger to my two lips 
Ooh, you got it bad, just remember what we had
You can set the snow on fire
The reason that you suffer is desire 
The reason that I'm moving with this ooh-wee
I was lovin' life, I got too deep 
Woke up in my room, she was long gone
Toni singing me another sad song 
Eternity
Oh, until we meet again
This ain't special, tell me what you want
This ain't special, baby, this is fun
This ain't special, tell me what you want
This ain't special, baby, this is fun
Drop it off , let me see if your booty soft
Gold mouth , yes, I'm from the Dirty South
Lights out , summertime, I brought the ice out 
Pipes out , all my shooters came from Moscow
Got a girl in Harvard, I talk proper when I call her 
Baby, I'm a baller, ain't no way that I can raw ya 
She don't want no new friends, she just tryna buy her a new Benz 
I've been counting M's, me and Ben Franklin damn near kin 
Put my mind to it and I did it, them facts 
Talkin' 'bout your brother to get some pussy, that's wack 
The police keep harassin' 'cause I'm rich and I'm black 
They mad 'cause I made myself a boss without crack 
I ain't trippin', boy, I'm Lamborghini whippin' 
Straight up out the trenches, money made me ign'ant 
I'm on a private jet eatin' Popeyes chicken 
I be flexin' like I'm eatin' Popeye's spinach 
Morning dew
Percolating, still have a little time for Sunday, ooh 
Baby, I might let you go
Babe, baby, no matter what
And like I switch the other side of me
Baby got a whole lotta ride on me
Babe, baby, let's take it back to crib
Back, back to the crib
Back, back to the, babe
I might let you go
Baby, baby, no matter what
And I can, I can, I can, I can
To the crib
Back to the crib, back to the
And no one seen them
Baby, I, baby, baby, IDon't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?
Can't sleep
3 a.m., stare at the ceiling, murder the feeling
Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse
So appropriate cornucopia, so be it, say I'm over it
Playing Lil Durk, "Dis Ain't What U Want"
Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk
Pass a Fatburger through Atwater village
Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me
Park by the bridge, sit on the hood
Look at the cars, stare at my hands, look at the moon
I can't find it, it's gone, what's wrong?
"Didn't respond when I texted you last night"
"You alright?"—yeah...
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?
Man is a star bound to a body inside of me
20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees
Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry
And half of an apple pie, when I'm laughing, I'm satisfied
When I'm dying, I'm still alive, strange position
I'm in a good mood, so good, I'ma kill that spider
In spite of the kinda things that they told me
Alone don't mean that you lonely
Alone means you finally get it, admit it
Go home, lock up the door, fold up the clothes
Watch some cartoons, turn off the lights
Look at the recluse, look at the recluse
Look at the recluse, look at the rec—
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go-oooI watch 'em all pass by the moon and stars
Let me hold him in my arms, forevermore
These cold nights, the park is ours
Standing, by the side
Let you go, on, to the sea, just for me
Don't ever leave me, my love
Keep holding on, let the modest go
As my mind goes to and fro, waking up for one more show
We see him in the night, tell him I'm not afraid of him
I'm not afraid of 'em, 'cause I won't knowMm mm mm
Doo doo doo da da da dum dum beh
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede, centipede, centipede...
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...
'Bino, will you be my baby daddy, yup
I'm too fresh, man, the world ain't never had me, yup
I'm too fresh, man, y'all ain't never gave me that
Stone Mountain, ain't no doubting, and these niggas won't hold me back
They wasn't hating him anyway
My roommate exercise, man, he moving that heavyweight
My girl ain't down to ride, couldn't deal with my day to day
I'm at my Grandma's house, man, like I don't know what to say
Maybe "I'm sorry" but sorry don't pay the rent
I promise to pay you back and I don't know where he at
But tell him he missing out, his grandson is cool as fuck
And tell me who be standing when them other ones giving up?
Let's keep it spontaneous, I don't need that rehearsal
More flow, man, than Progressive commercials
Get with the program, 'cause the plus loan ain't putting us on
I got month-long before I take the bus home
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...
I know this music shit ain't shit
And all these random niggas in my house make you anxious
And I ain't never told you that our love would be painless
But I was so in love with you I thought we could make it
Damn, I wasn't in it, damn, we wasn't finished
Damn, I got us tickets, damn, we went to Venice
Prioritize on our lives and made you into a business
That's why you wasn't surprised when I had made my decision
Gotta make it, 'cause if not I'm a failure, my wallet Azalea
And my brother still moving, ain't no shit I can tell him
Trying keep him out of trouble, but the cops is wilding
And it's nice to have a felon when the boys get violent
The Mexicans tried to jump me at the club
Funny thing was I thought they were stepping to show me love
Grandma's couch, my biggest fear, and fantasy
When I ain't in her arms all I'm making is enemies
Here I'm screaming obscenities at a nigga
Wanted to live bigger
Them Edenwald projects was eatin' our concept
Of anyone walking out, what is you talking about?
Gun Hill Road made them summers feel cold
On the same train that my parents met on
Twenty years later and my thoughts still ghetto
High off of pressure, man, that's a stiletto
Got your own couch now but you don't feel better
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...
'Cause if not, I'm a failure
'Cause if not, I'm a failure
'Cause if not, I'm a failure
"It's not an unholy nigga, it's a Arab nigga in the store. You know what he want? Money, nigga. You know what your bitch want, you know why they feel they can't fuck with you? 'Cause you don't have no money, my nigga. Bitches do not want a nigga with no money. Did you not learn this in Harlem? Lesson number one. You can't keep saying you a Harlem nigga and you don't want that skrilla, nigga. Come on B, it's home of the hustlers, nigga. Nigga, that's all you gotta understand. It's the hood nigga. It's make guap or die, nigga."
"What do you think? 'Cause he gotta know, my nigga. Money is not evil, nigga. Go tell them niggas in Polo you don't wanna make no money, nigga. What they gon' say, "Oh, he right"? Hell no, nigga. You think niggas like selling crack and shit nigga? You think niggas like putting crack in they ass nigga, and selling cracks out they ass? You think niggas like shooting niggas, my nigga? You think niggas like tucking packs? You think niggas like baggin' up? You know how boring baggin' up is, my nigga? It's so boring, my nigga. There is no underground, Joe Budden is on his fourth mixtape selling shit. The underground is Koch, nigga. There is no underground nigga. You don't see Raekwon or none of these niggas on the block. You don't see none of them niggas on the block. There's no more block, nigga, it's over for the block. You ask any nigga on the block, do they wanna be on the block? They gon' say no, nigga. Get your money, man. Stop trying to be gooned out, my nigga
"Hood niggas don't want to be—"
"Hood niggas don't want to be hood niggas, my nigga. Everything niggas do, everything niggas do in the hood is for money, my nigga. What's one thing that niggas do in the hood that ain't for money? What bitch would want a nigga with no money? Huh? Huh!? Yo, slime! It's your time."Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
First off let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine
So I'll probably use the B word a couple times
I used to love your fucking mouth, you had enough of mine
But what's the reason for, you never gave me any sign
When we were making out you kind of act like it was nothing
Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or something
You know I'm fine with getting fucked by girls who are my friends
You fucked me in a different way, I guess it all depends
Texting on my day off, "Hey babe what's going on?"
"Sorry I can't make it out", sad face emoticon
It's funny how I see you with these bad boys you hanging on
I told ya I'm a soldier need a girl scout to tag-a-long
Face down ass up, that's the way you left me
I thought there was a spark but we were missing Lisa Leslie
"You know it's fucking childish to write a song to get me"
I'm always fucking childish you knew that when you met me
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
You ain't that fine bitch what the fuck you heard?
I love these shitty ass chicks I guess I'll never learn
I hate it when you think you really getting something good
And you don't listen to your dudes when you really should
I got so many fucking girls I can't even count 'em
There's probably six or seven girls who think this song's about them
Never kiss in public but at home I am affectionate
Fucking bitches left and right my dick is ambidextrous
I know you probably texting this lyric to your friends
Saying "This nigga think he all that. He fucking sucked in bed", well uhh…
I think we both know that I worked that ass
I hope your dude can keep it stretched, yoga class
I'm trying hard not to use a specific reference
But you'll probably know that it's you after the first sentence
So let me quit while I'm ahead like a penis tip
If I never was in love with you I hope you know I'm meaning it
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Nobody really wants you
Nobody really wants you
Nobody really wants you, wants you, wants youThere's a bottom to the top of a moment
You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind you
People want you underground
Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run too fast
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
I'm spinning, I'm spinning, I'm spinning you up
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one that's terrified, ooh
Just hide, ooh!
You know that you're the one, that's terrified, ooh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please
Ooh-oh, no, no, no, ooh!
Oh, you can't run from me
You can't hide from meI know it's your first
I will try to be gentle
My love....
Worst rapper to ever spit on an open mic
Worst rapper to ever get on so many likes
Worst rapper to ever blow up and over night
And when my D swell my D-12 friends, but Obie Trice
Young, black and gifted but he still in America
Heard the flow was gettin' better, is he sleeping with Erykah?
They passing me they demos, these rappers, I think it's funny
Cause they tryna get my demo, young white kids with money
I promise, worst rapper, iTunes most played
It's just me and both Macs, self made, self paid
Headlines saying he leaving to be a rapper
With niggas saying:
"This dummy; he eating off of his acting, I mean
Who the fuck wanna be a rapper, it's stupid, I mean
Who knew that every rapper with a new crew
Wanna do shit on Hulu,"—that's the blueprint
You drive until the lease up
I drive until it's dirty, please somebody call a Brinks truck
Yeah they know me, happy face emoji
That OG, I might OD so Avengers keep it lowkey 
Well I'm sitting on top of the world
There's only one second secure
And I can't get it back
My life is a sham, no time to react; breathe
Find solace in the fact my ball bigger
Pause, like dog fingers
Give a fuck 'bout y'all niggas
Get the point like ball kickers
I do shit, eat good, need a toothpick
Your girl play my music
So that's thumbs down to your new shit
Buddha stance on a forest on the ayahuasca
I'm as high as copters, binoculars
Looking down on my confidence
Truly honest man, I wish there was more of us freaking out
I wet the bed the first night on my tour bus
God damn, what you doing man?
I can't name a lot of rappers that you better than
He hates women and himself, I won't give him the chance
Tear myself down first to make 'em pay in advance
Heard a lot of y'all talking behind his back
When he walking out
Me and Fam in the corner, what are they talking 'bout?
The same dudes who laughing after you go
Be the same dudes emailing asking you 'bout your show
It's on FX? Tight nigga
Me and my homies making flicks
Me and my homies making beats
Me and my homies making hits
Me and my homies hit the spot, roll with us, gold diggers
I don't really like those niggas, Childish like goldfishes
We saw this kid get shot up by the cops in Atlanta
They shot through his Phantom
And tandem cannons were blamming him
He was standing there like 20 seconds before
Now he gasping for air, bullet holes inside of his dome
What's the point? I don't know
Why am I here? Why am I alive? Why do you care?
Living real everyday, what was your undoing?
Khalifa's first name now there's urine on him 
Damn 'Bino why you gotta do it to em?
I'm Terio, I'm Terio, my cousin "Ooooh-ahh-Ooh-ing"
New shit, new shit alert, never fake 
There's levels to the shit like a wedding cake
My new girl so pretty that the world shine
My new girl getting kissed by the coastline
My new girl so pretty we can bovine
Worst rapper ever, how I'm giving out a cosign?
Chance The Rapper, yeah that nigga crazy
Big brother, little brother lifestyle wavy
Cool, uhhh...I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
‘Cause ya know, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you
No, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you, oh
Hard for a Pitchfork, soft for a Roc-a-Fella
Music was my side chick, but now we’re moving in together
Always felt misunderstood, I guess I have to tolerate
My swag Jehovah Witness, dude, it never take a holiday
APC jeans, brown leather jacket on
Kitsuné cable knit, cardigan from Rag & Bone
Thick Filipino chick, homemade bracelet
Her booty make her just a rapper, she ain’t gotta say shit
I’m someone they admire
Set the game ablaze, I’m an arcade fire
Laughed at my rise like my motion was funny
Yes, ashy to classy, my lotion is money
The ride is easy when the dollar’s there to grease the wheels
Now everybody tell me what to do and how to feel
It seems the more I try to connect with the world
I am feeling more alone than I ever have felt before
I wanna pick up the phone, ask my dad how to handle it
But what will happen when my dad’s not there to answer it?
I try to clear my mind of thoughts that only slow me down
Like when these niggas called me "faggot" and we homies now
But we are not homies, I just keep you around
‘Cause all your talkin’ is the noise I need to kill the sound
Of all these voices tellin’ me no one can help me out
We are alone, I’m just the only one to figure out
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
‘Cause ya know, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you
No, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you, oh
"You are the bestest, I will obey you"
These words I wrote for you when you were fuckin’ other dudes
The only thing I need from you now is some solitude
Actions over words, "girls will be girls," that’s all it proves
I used to be this guy sittin’ with an open heart
Now my computer screen’s the only place I feel a spark
I don’t fuck with fake bitches
Except for when I fuck with fake bitches
Canon 5D to take pictures
Of these girls who wouldn’t talk to me a year ago
49er chick askin’ for money, she get zero, though
Here I go again, talkin’ money, women and clothes and cars, right?
You could switch all of my words out with Plies’, right?
People sayin’ we’re the same, please, come from under me
We are just some rappers, got no luxury of subtlety
No subjects when we’re rappin’, we say it like we hear it
I put it on a track and I hope you get the spirit ‘cause
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be alone
I don’t wanna be alone
‘Cause ya know, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from you
No, somewhere inside, I cannot find
The feeling I got from youNow that we have found this love, baby
I can't explain my feel, oh
Now that we have found this love, baby
I've never felt this real, oh
Loving you is all I know, baby
You make me feel so high, oh no
I just wanna feel your love, baby
You know I'm down to ride, oh no no
When your song is on and your hand's in mine
And I'm holding you tight, make it feel good
Let me hold it down, I'm so glad we found
It's whenever you like, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
Now that we have found this love, baby
These haters can't say shit, oh
I know sometimes it's hard when I'm so far
I know you miss this di-love
Let's go somewhere far away, baby
Where we don't need no phone, oh
Cause now that we have found this love, baby
You'll never be alone, oh oh
When your song is on and your hand's in mine
And I'm holding you tight, make it feel good
Let me hold it down, I'm so glad we found
It's whenever you like, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
Make it feel good, make it feel good, alright
Make it feel good, make it feel good
All my friends are telling me, oh
You need to slow it down, yeah
But I'm so tired of wasting all this time
I need your love right now
Give it to me like oh, ooh yeah
All that I want now, yeah
Give it to me like oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, give it to me like
Make you feel good, make you feel good, alright
Make you feel good, make you feel good
Make you feel good, make you feel good, alright
Make you feel good, make you feel good
I used to walk on the beach at night
I remember
The best time was when well, me and you
We got all our friends and we got a tent
We slept in it
Not the whole night, but just enough time
Magic happened, nothing was born luckily
It's up to me, but
Then we left
The times have changed
The pleasures that I feel
They say you never say never, it's real
Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep
I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep
I'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room Under the moon, romance
Hold on, brotherShe want to move to California
She must've fucking lost her mind
She want to move to California
That's how they get you every time
She make a movie with her friends
Put it up in a minute
Everybody say it now
Ain't no loop at the minute
Everybody saying
"How, how you do it, you did it?"
I'ma show you what it done
But enough for a finish
Pay attention, you listen
You keep losing your mind
How you want to loop this shit
But looking like a Vine?
But they no pay for no privilege
Now she broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
Better get your percentage
In California, oh
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly
All the people all around and the follower people
I go watching a "haha," make a girlfriend giggle
Make her feel so official, make it Serena Vista
Supernova, new residual, making money a little
Make the smoker illegal
Make the living illegal
Make the laughing illegal
Make it snap for a people
When you make a movie now
Know you making no difference
It's a tickle on the mind
'Fore me finish your sentence
So go pimp a like on Vine,
But don't pay for the privilege
Now you broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
Better get your percentage
Oh, you broke in Koreatown
In that condo you rented
Better get your percentage
In California
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
I want to move to California
I want to hang with DC FlyLittle hands, little feet
Tiny heart, tiny beat
Oh, thinkin' 'bout the time we spent falling in love together
I don't wanna leave you, I don't wanna deceive you
But oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies
Oh my, please don't take him away, mama
Don't take him away, oh
'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close
All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one
And they know your son
Oh, please don't take him away
You say you won't but you will, yes you will
'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close
There was a time before you
And there will be a time after you
Though these bodies are not our own
Walk tall, little one, walk tall
Let me hold you, let me hold you
Can I hold you?I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all
I'm hopin' that it's cause I'm livin' everything I want
I used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights, putting on a stone face
He's saving up so we can get our own place
In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me
They called me "fat nose," my mom say, "You handsome to me"
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood
They think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit
But all they get now is, "Can your son read this script?"
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
Yeah, Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face, she still made dinner
“Donald watch the meter so they don’t turn the lights off"
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He’s supposed to pay ‘em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads
Under the pillow, like that would do somethin'
But she’s got six kids, she’s gotta do somethin'
She don’t want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad cause his father ain’t around
He lookin’ at me now, like
"Why you so fuckin lucky? I had a father too
But he ain’t around so I'mma take it out on you"
We used to say "I love you," now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you’re the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over, I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are
Because you’re young and black, don’t believe ‘em
You’re still that kid who kept the older boys
From teasin', for some reason
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Oh, help us Lord
Oh, baby, baby, babySmall chick with a fat ass
Did I say that out loud? Let me back track
I know my game ain’t that bad
Have you ever made out with a Gap ad?
And girls want what they can’t have
So I don’t text back when the screen flash
You love me? You mean cash
Need a friend you can fuck, I can be that
Crush girls now, couldn’t last year
Oh, you like me now? Well that’s weird
Last year you were chillin’ with Lil Wayne
Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same?
My work is my playtime
I need you to understand and to stay fine
Do this and I just might wife you
Let me poke you, ma, Raichu
Fuck your life
I don’t really think I drank enough tonight
Looking at you, make me wanna fuck for life
Lame ass dudes gon’ suck tonight
But so are these girls, am I wrong or right?
Girl, do somethin’ to me
“Nah, baby, you way too hood for me”
Y’all girls have never been good for me
Watch a nigga take over, mutiny
I wanna fuck with the lights on
Hey, girl, let a python slide on
Stay sick, infect me, Lysol
I’m on the edge, they hoping that I might fall
I make it work, I’m running with a new crew
And we do dope shit you ain’t used to
For me, by me, fuck Fubu
This girl never heard of me, go and check YouTube
I got a house with a dope view
See the ocean, dope shit, you an ’06, I’m an ’02
But enough about high school
I’m getting laid, or I’m getting lied to
You my stand-in Cameron, let me be your A-Rod
You number one in The Pack, Based God
Should I say something dumb to give us something to fight about?
Never mind, lights out
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me
Swag
2:30 and we still making progress
Talking on Twitter, see where to go next
3:30, man, where did the time go?
I’m chilling with this Asian chick I met in Chicago
She look like the Social Network chick
Except for her ass is twice as thick, man
Just wanna bite that shit
Where the fuck did my license went?
I must've left it at the other place
I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space
Yeah, we doing stupid shit, have stories when I’m older
But I don’t wanna see pictures of us on Vulture
Never thought about a year ago
I’m chillin’ out with the friends at the Super Bowl
Things change like a motherfuck
That’s why I wild out, keep the city up
Uh, I talk a lot about the girls in my songs
But you are different from the girls in my songs
Stop talking ’bout the girls in my songs
If you don’t like it, I can just take you home
More green than the top of these tree trunks
Leave your boyfriend here, ’cause he bunk
She like, “I’m not a slut”—speed bump
By the way, what’s your name? ‘Cause we drunk
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it 
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose 
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing 
Show me what you do to me, me
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me
I gots to get high
I need to get high
Uh, I needs to get high
Uh, I gots to get highOne time I was at the beach
And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was,  had stars on it as well
So it looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess
I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night
You were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure, so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was yours—it was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me
On this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends
Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the Sudafed
Cause the flow cold, like a SoCo
I was smoking smoking John Lennon where my Yoko?
This that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet
Verbal mania, imma show you the illest, get my cousin to kill it
Had a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out
Got the top down in the back we could fall out
We could fall out, nigga we could fall out
Your girlfriend push a Prius, she giving me that genius
Mensa, we that Tony Danza
Wine on the rug man you know that shit expensive
I'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka
Vape so good and the pot like lobster
Nigga, I'm a monster, fuck it, I'm a mon-star
Man, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car
That's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard
Turn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
I guess this ending's the best for me
But I can't leave you behind
You know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind
Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn
Yo it's kinda hard not to like, get fucking cheesy on this shit
But, does that even matter?
You know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man
Juxta-fucking-position
My nigga Jaden Smith dropping  jewels and niggas don't believe him cause he's Jaden Smith
But it's all about packaging right?
Real shit though, good and bad is all relative man
It really is, a lot of niggas is sheep
We don't even know what we like anymore
We just know what the most hype is
Shit, do you really like that shit you like?
Or you like the way they gave it to you?
You know what I'm saying?
Pepsi, Coca-Cola same thing
Dave Chapelle said that, the one that taste the best
Was the one that was paying him the most at the time
That's all that happens with us man
We some weak niggas man, all of us
Followers, sheeps, plural made that shit up
Apologin' ain't no real word my nigga
We know this, but he knows more cause he broke the rules that don't even fucking exist man
Funny thing is man is like, as a futurist
And I can call myself a futurist
Nobody is even going to give a fuck until I'm gone
So does it even matter?
Yes it does...There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever
Pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's
Bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep
Me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me
Breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hands
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hands
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it--
Swag
You think that I keep fucking other girls, you know I'm not
Come back to me like hipsters to Blogspot
Let me kiss you on your neck and make your heart stop
I'll give your new dude a fat lip: Pharcyde
I wrote another song, I'm not where I belong
My eyes water when I see hers: catalogue
I never thought you were a cheater, that was all
I need to get ahold of my head: jacking off
You ran back to them grody-ass indie dudes
James Perse cardigans, scuffed-up tennis shoes
Wow, girl, that's what you really wanted, huh?
A Michael Cera knockoff, I guess I wasn't white enough
You said I wasn't capable of loving you, I never was
A twenty-something nigga touring the world with hella buzz
I'm saying that my life's swell: cortizone
Fuck Macaulay Culkin, never going home alone
IPhone photos, show 'em just to mock you
Read your Twitter messages, too proud to block you
Spread shit around, "You know that his glasses fake"
That's why I'm dating girls now whose asses ain't
"Damn, Donald, why you gotta be so mean?"
I'm a nice guy, that's why you broke up with me
You probably in the club dancing to this right now
Play it cool, text me when you walk out
It's just childish
It's just childish
It's just childishFADE IN
INT. DONALD'S ROOM. - MORNING
DONALD is woken by a knock on his window from an unknown GIRL
GIRL
Phone
DONALD looks over through the window, sits up, puts on his shirt, and walks out to the phone
DONALD
Hello?
WOMAN 
Hello, who's this?
DONALD
You called me
WOMAN 
This is the Callifax Collection Company. Who am I speaking with?
DONALD
I know who you're looking for; he's not here
WOMAN
Do you know where he can be reached?
DONALD
What month is it?
WOMAN 
Uh, it is June I believe
DONALD
Then he's probably in the Northern Hemisphere somewhere
CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
DONALD fixes himself some cereal and grabs a bottle of San Pelligrino out of the fridge

DONALD is sitting against a tree and holding the lemons that DANIELLE picks and hands to him
DANIELLE
I've had the most strangely reoccurring dreams over the last week. And uh, it's like of my wedding, but nothing is going right. Everything's a disaster. My guests are all there, it's all of my real life friends. They all look gorgeous. They're all like fully done up in their gowns that they're probably going to wear to the wedding, my family is there. But suddenly I realize I should've been married by now, and I'm not married, I'm not in my wedding dress. I'm all alone, in this giant area where I see my guests being served their cocktail appetizers off of paper plates. Everyone seems to be having a great time, but they're eating off of paper plates. But I am wearing cargo pants. Army cargo pants
DONALD
Like Old Navy?
DANIELLE
Yeah, exactly. Like Old Navy cargo pants. I don't own Old Navy cargo pants. I'm not even sure where that came from in my head, but I'm wearing that with a T shirt and I'm supposed to be getting married. My hair's not done, my makeup's not done. And my mom comes in and asks me, "Why aren't you getting ready for your wedding?" And I'm like "Oh, I will be, I will be" but suddenly I'm smoking a cigarette, I even don't know why I'm smoking a cigarette, but in my mind I also that I'm three or four weeks pregnant. Horrible, right? So I tell my mom, "Mom, you don't know this, but I'm three or four weeks pregnant" and she says not "Put down the cigarette", she says, "Maybe you should get into your wedding dress". It's all very, very weird. I'm not sure what it means at all
DONALD
I think we have too many lemons
DANIELLE
One more?
DONALD
Yeah
DANIELLE
And these two
DONALD
Yeah, some of them. That'll be enough

A MONTAGE:
A group of people are dancing around speakers. Assumingly, music is playing, but the events of that scene are muted, and replaced by the dialogue of...
INT. MOVIE ROOM. - NIGHT
DONALD and FLYING LOTUS are exchanging verses they've written
FLYING LOTUS
Investing time on writing lies, slightly truth without a clue
I met my higher self, pissing off the roofs of drunken goofs
He said "keep the mic smelly like a rotten tooth"
And all your fears forgotten when the Cap is in the booth
I'm an angel in an agony of flame
Feathers growing at the mention of my name, reinvention of my shame
I'm a slave to the darkness of my innermost cave
And all these words I hold tighter than a glowstick at a rave, nigga
Dance around the camp fire, buttnaked, blowing trees
Could give a single fuck if somebody sees, I'm free
Red "V" bleed out a scarlet letter, kill a king
And I'll sitting ready for whatever weather the seasons sing
Picking up expensive habits, chasing after little rabbits
Hope they lead me to a place of magic
Sad at all the times I never thought I had it
Losing all these memories, and y'all doubt it matters...
Patterns
DONALD
Mouth to a Pellegrino, bottle color of envy
Who the fuck is Gambino, I hand a waitress a benji
To act like she never met me, I'm saying though
They want the game changed when your shit on the radio
Fruit was so hanging low, I didn't even bother
She tryna land Obama's, man she get it from her mama
I don't blame her, I tame her, give her something to visualize
On my couch watching DVR'd "American Dad"
Man those new Celine bags are so to die for
I'm in that Porsche on Prozac, them suicide doors
Watch her walk as the death becomes her
Cause Mrs. Tarantino kill bills, no wonder
My heaven is the present, so maybe this is it.
Pray to God every night to make me believe he exists
Drink a fifth of vodka, I don't need no sponsor,
Heard a preacher holler, make him hold these souls
And that's when like the hook...
FLYING LOTUS
Yeah that's tight. I like that
You know you got a little...
He points to DONALD's nose, and DONALD touches it to find blood dripping
DONALD
Oh shit
FLYING LOTUS
Yeah
DONALD gets up, and runs to the bathroom
FLYING LOTUS
Wow
CUT TO:
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
DONALD examines his nose in the mirror, surprised by the bleeding
He looks for the source of all the blood, and notices and obstruction in his nasal passage- it's a string
Nauseated and scared, he pulls the long, blood soaked string while gagging and coughing. Finally, he dislodges the string and what is attached at the end, a golden tooth
He places it next to the sink and washes his hands, as the sound of the running water transitions into a similar sound of the shower water as DONALD now sits in the shower
He is still, and his back is to us
CUT TO:
EXT. POOL AREA - NIGHT
DONALD and FAM are sitting next to a bonfire, eating s'mores and swapping childhood stories
FAM
I remember being seventeen, being scared as hell. Getting prank calls, like crazy stuff. Just like senior year in high school. Had a lot of girls, it's crazy. So, this one girl, she was super crazy, she would call my phone from a blocked number, and it was her. But then I started getting like the crazy death threats. Started as a joke, then they knew exactly what kind of car I was driving, where I liked to hang out. Then they started shooting in the area, so I couldn't sleep at home anymore. Went and got a gun from my friend. Started sleeping on the street for a week. The scariest thing about it all though, is having a gun knowing you might have to use it. scarier than than killing somebody is thinking about killing somebody. Sometimes you can't explain why things happen. Those seven days, man, just couldn't handle it. Just couldn't handle it. You just get to that point like why did I get here? Sometimes they just do
DONALD
When I was like five or six, we were living in Decatur, in the projects. On Commerce Drive. It's nice now, but like we were living there and I remember my mom's friend. Like a friend of the family. This kid like... Something happened, I didn't understand it but he had to stay with us for a couple of day. I didn't really understand it. But we didn't have any space. So he had to sleep in my bed. I remember in the morning waking up and he was like "Let's rub butts". I was like "okay" like whatever I did it. And I didn't really get it. And then I turned, when we turned he kissed me
FAM
He kissed you?
DONALD
Yeah. Like you said, I don't know why it happened. I don't know why it happened
FAM
Did anybody like know about this?
DONALD
Nah, just him
FAM
That's wild
DONALD
It's crazy
FAM
Like I said, sometimes you just can't explain things
DONALD
I'm gonna go inside
FAM
Alright, I gonna stay out here, man
DONALD begins to walk inside as we...
CUT TO:
HALLWAY
DONALD is walking to his room, as the GIRL passes him in the opposite direction
He turns, quizzically
DONALD
Who are you?
She doesn't respond, or even look at him, and keeps walking. Donald continues walking to his room
CUT TO:
INT. DONALD'S ROOM. - NIGHT
He is flying face up, eyes closed. The phone rings and he opens his eyes
He leans over and picks up the phone
WOMAN 
Hello, who's this?
DONALD immediately hangs up, looks down for a moment, and takes off his sweatshirt and shirt
He lies down and falls back asleep
FADE OUTWhen the sun is rising over streets so barren
Since the evening, colors flash before my eyes
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92
I listened to what my father said
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can
How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
We may cry alone, I feel we know where all of this is headed
But my mama said
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
Oh I, nah, nah, nah
If you are strong, you cannot fall
If you are strong, oh no
There is a voice inside us all
So smile, ohh, when you can, ohh, when you can
If you cannot, oh!
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side, woo, oh
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is more out there
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Oh!
Give me a moment, oh, oh, oh
When they're gone, keep to yourself
Oh, oh, woo, oh, ooh, yeah!
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Oh! Oh!
Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
Oh! Oh!
(Keep on your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall)

So fuck y'all, all y'all, if y'all don't like me, good
Put that on my partner man, I wish a nigga would
I say we ain't playing man I hope that's understood
I'm in my zone though, fucking 'round with that 4-0
Eating my mamas salmon but skipping on the risotto
Girl said that she need the follow, tweet her and she'll do any
Man, I'm trying to stay off, readin' 'em makes me angry
On the back on the tour bus, recording the two of us
Stacks at the Apple store, man this ballin' is new to us
Trying to make amends, bailing on all my friends
Niggas went to the club, sent a beat to Gucci instead
Man I'm feelin' right, my nigga Fam yellin', "Don't stop"
And half my crew is always faded on some low top
Stopped drinking for the most part
My only vices all our pictures on my laptop
Screaming at me saying, "I ain't what you really want"
Christina's parents baby all I make is Milians
We got the shows, we got the paper, but I want respect

Now that I'm one percent, I send most of it home
I want to stunt but she need to pay off her student loans
And everybody saying, "Get it while you hitting man
We want them harder beats, that 808 you slipping man"
Dude is so stupid popping anything they hand me
On that parking lot pimping and politicking in Miami
In that home of the D where they sell that cake batter
Heard a voice in the back, hate from all the fake rappers
That I shitted on, shitted on
Shitted on, shitted on
Rap your soul, dude, let the mic blaze
Show 'em A-Town, East Side, all day
I put it on, I put it on
I put it on, I put it on
Life is somethin' IMAX, film is at a climax
I ain't even started, was it stupid I departed?
Man, probably, but now we do the things we always wanted
I'm proud of me, cause I am undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with
Please somebody cum laude me
Graduated, anticipated the hatred and doubted me
Not a prodigy, just a hard worker from the Dean's List
But most these rappers doin' so-so like a seamstress
Jesus

They playing Jeezy like that shit came out yesterday
Thug motivation, I was never a thug and they used to respect me for it
But now the game's fucked up and I gotta Michael Corleone these niggas
Quiet, confident, I talked to her
She came with you, but she left with me
And now she's in the passenger seat
So, where we going?
Just away 
Which leaves you standing there thinking
You don't have to call, babyOh, this is the idea where you're doing, like, one piece of artwork per track
That's dope
Late ass nights come from long days
Doin' all the right things in the wrong ways
Doin' all the wrong shit for the right reasons
Sprinklin' midnight game, call it night seasoning
Haters get salty give 'em cholesterol
Trill O.G, mop up the floor with the best of y'all
Then dry that bitch off with the rest of y'all
And catch a flight to Rio de Janero for la festival
Yeah, and that's word to fit a baldy
Ball hard like it's cement inside of my Spalding
And I'll break your face with a no look pass
Now back to your parking lot pimp with yo little hook ass
I use harsh words cause these are hard times
And trill-ass people, nowadays they're such a hard find
So it's one eye open if I could peep ‘em
And one on the scope, so if they frontin' I can sleep 'em
Man, my flow is so parabolic
The energy'll blow you over even if you're brolic
Goddamn it, now that's one for the Googlers

Niggas who wasn't feelin' me secretly want a handout
Keep your mouth shut, I can probably help your man out
Drop a new stack all lames get to steppin'
Drop a new track all blogs go to heaven
Kill the web, man these niggas need they hits up
Kiss her neck, add a dime to the tip cup
She is not "slut," fuck a dude who says so
Just because she's fuckin' doesn't mean she ain't a lady
Kill the whole stage, I never needed a mic check
Semen on my spacebar, fuckin' tired of Skype sex
Runnin' with a new breed, me and Bun B
This hip-hop nation, that big country
Nigga, please! We ain't stop for no one
Wu-Tang Generator name, I'm a shōgun

Rolled up sleeves, nigga lookin’ like a greaser
Word is born, baby my dictionary’s in labor
Listen to the Culdesac and know that was an ultimatum man
Why nobody wanna admit they like me just a little bit?
Won’t be on the freshmen list, guess I’ll just keep spittin’ shit
Never be the rapper with six hundred dollar shades
No iced-out chain, Rod Lavers all day
I was hopin’ they would see me just for me, dope rhymer
They do me like my first house, no co-signer
See you usin’ qualifiers, you don’t even know
“I guess he good for a rapper who on a TV show”
Even though, I was rappin’ back when Lance had chemo, ho
Even flow, Pearl Jammin’ niggas can’t leave me alone
I keep a bone for these girls who liked me back when green was low
Feel me, though, DVR my thoughts and make your TiVo grow
Runnin’ through the moment as the sun goes down 
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound 
But it’s all for you to prove it, keep on movin’, keep on usin’
My shine, my shine, my shine
Ooh, take me higher
Gambeezy make it work somethin’, let me check the syntax
Don’t add an eezy to my name, ’cause it has never been that
Aladdin on you fuckers, prince of the game from street rat
Dudes fall off, too steep like tea bags
Steady movin’, don’t worry about where I’mma be
Cause I’mma be on these tracks like indie girls on Amelie
Honesty, I’m rappin’ ’bout everything I go through
Everything I’m sayin’, I’m super sayin’ like Goku
Fuck nerdcore, fuck backpack
Fuck rap cool, I make cool rap
I make music for wack blacks to blast back
In fact, I swear the track I lie on’s my last track
Running through the moment as the sun goes down 
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound 
But it’s all for you to prove it, keep on movin’, keep on usin’
My shine, my shine, my shine
Ooh, take me higher
Running through the moment as the sun goes down 
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound 
But it’s all for you to prove it, keep on movin’, keep on usin’
My shine, my shine, my shine
Ooh, take me higherFlow so pneumonia, yo bitch want my boner
I take her 'round the corner then I gave the ho a bonus
Bitches wanna bone us, we ain't cubic zirconia
But I will never own 'em so to me them bitches loners
On the deck, and a tongue flip like the "my" in "My Sharona"
Got her drip, drip, drippin' like that lemon and Corona
Bank roll thick like that neck on Sabonis
But I will never trick, you just get dick and balonis
Take that tenderoni, and now she ride my pony
And cheese came with it like a snatch of pepperoni
I'm an O.G., I'm with CG
You a he-she, nigga run you back like a repeat
I'm a pill-poppin' ET, Givenchy on a ten-speed
Hot like Britney in '03, ya know me
Smokin' on that Toxic, sippin' on an O.E
Dippin' in that Molly got me higher than some Flow C
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Fandango my Mandingo, we should do a movie
Groupies lookin' like the Yakuza in my Jacuzzi
Excuse me I'm on that ooey, my pockets are life with Louis
Euros is different colors, my wallet look like a Coogi
He who speakin' the least is Chief Keefin' the peace
Leavin' seeds in yo niece, prayin' that she ain't late
Sprayin' like that AK, now that shit my namesake
'Bino you so nasty, ass like an ashtray
Smokin' Flying Lotus, used to be Jehovah's
I'm in yo girl and now she feeling Polish like pierogies
They hopin' that they smoke us
N'aw man, never that
Trippin' off that earwax, Danny Brown and D-Stacks
Ill pandemic, man that shit be everywhere
Midas is your highness and you Haribo like Gummi bears
Why I'm fly like a cockpit, you don't fly like a ostrich
Stupid shit like a mosh pit, can't believe this is "Toxic"
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come downI had a dream I ran Atlanta
And I was on every radio station
And 107.9 was 97.5 again
And they played me at Golden Glide on Friday
And they played me real loud on the street
We drive up Memorial Drive, up Wesley Chapel
I reopen 112, and Jazzy T's
I'd bring back Turner Field. I fire all the cops in Cobb county
Chick-Fil-A will be open on Sundays
I bring back LaFace Records, Freaknik, Kilo Ali, Lou
I get J.R. Crickets some Spelman girls with big booties
I reopen SciTrek, strippers will get Mother's Day off
And I'd have my own Gangsta Grillz mixtape
Hey, this is Steve Smith from American Dad
And this is Royalty

In Gambino we trust! 
Royalty is forever
DJ Drama is forever 
Y'all ready?

I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em
Nigga, I was stuntin', keep that shit a hundred
If it ain't about the money, then it's not up for discussion
If it ain't about—
After selling out the Georgia Dome 3 nights in a row
After selling 10 million copies of his newest album
Roscoe's Wetsuit in one week!
After successfully petitioning to recarve his own face into Stone Mountain  
He's still givin' you niggas a free mixtape?
Why, Gambino? Why young guy? Why so generous?
I ain't no snitch, cops I don't trust 'em
I ain't no bitch, all I do is run 'em 
Nigga, I was stuntin', keep that shit a hunnid
If it ain't about the money then it's not up for discussion
If it ain't about progress, ain't about success
Why this nigga suspect? You ain't seen sus' yet
I'ma fuck the game so hard like Tiffney
Niggas taking shots, I'm like "Nigga, don't tempt me"
I seen what you make, yeah, them shows sold out
But you doing clubs and I'm doing like all out things
"Why the hell he rapping if he all out sings?"
Royalty the movement, we all out kings
For real, Bino on a mission
We are not friends, nigga, this is business
Girl, this my dream, ain't no split decisions
Watch me cut this bitch off, I'ma need some scissors
Mama in the kitchen, hot sauce on them chitlins
I was always spittin', just that no one else was listening
Got your girl and now we kissing, she attracted to my vision
Now she see what she was missin', now she act a little different
Telling you she need some distance
Yeah, come on over, we can talk about it
Now this nigga mad, yeah, he thought about it
But he don't really want it, semen on her stomach
That's a second coming; Jesus
Flow so genius, can't low-key this
Puffin' on a swisher like a ho smoke penis
They want me Uncle Remus, but I'm just flexin' on 'em
This on some old Atlanta shit. But I like it cause, it's not about what you know, but who you know. Know what I'm saying?
Royalty my partna dem, no one else my partna dem
Stay strapped with that arsenal
These niggas winnin', it's hard to tell
Move over, we about to take over
Slide up in them DMs, her nigga didn't even notice, I'm focused
Yeah, I'm the man of the hour
Play me on Power, play me on Hot
Nigga I'm hot, nigga don't stop
Flow so cold put a cherry on top
Haters so mad, he ain't even know why, probably all the autonomy
Fuck all your feelings, I'm proud of me
Head was so good it's psychology
God damn, I'm just being who I am
From that weird ass little kid to this ballin' ass grown man
Man this beat is going so HAM, flow been burr since Novem'
Chain been burr since Novem'
That means cold, I'm just sayin', we ain't playin'
If your man don't want to lick it, I volunteer as tribute
You niggas on them Hunger Games, I'm eating Os like onion rings
I kill them hoes so constantly, I ain't even gotta sugar coat it
See them titties, wanna motorboat it
I'm Dopaliscious like SpottieOttie
Y'all don't know me, run the world
Turnin' up like that little girl, like, ayy-ayy-ayy-turn up
Tell them niggas it's tax season
Atlanta Georgia, that's black Sweden
I'm such a martyr, die for the game
I'm such a MARTA I'm runnin' trains like whoo
Slow that shit, felt that shit
Let me hear itWhat kind of love just stays the same?
What kind of love don't die alone?
What kind of love would take this long?
What kind of love don't make you old?
Meet me at the studio
I just wanna play you something
Meet me at the studio
I just wanna tell you something
'Cause you satisfy my heart
Even though we'll fall apart
Can't remember how to start—little lies
You like to call me koala
I'll be your Simba, you're Nala
Wherever you go I'll follow—little lies
Drove for hours just to see your face
Sorry—
Drove for hours just to see your face
We should've talked if just to clear the space
But now we stare at each other
Buried whatever feeling that was
He texts to "keep your heart D-stacks, keep your heart
These girls are smart D-stacks, these girls are smart"
I know...
Why get a dog? It's just gonna die
Everything you love's just gonna leave you one day
And that's just real shit he can still spit
But what's the point?
I said a lot of stupid stuff
I think that I was growin' up
What kind of love don't hurt so bad?
What kind of love don't feel this way?
What kind of love would make me fold?
Little lies, little lies
Little lies, little lies
Little lies, little lies
Na, na-na, na, na-na, na-na
Little liesSomebody tell they people what the fuck is up

Gettin' spiffy for these bitches I be eyeing
Fredward Mercury was playin' while I'm ridin' 
Down the Ryan, in a Scion 
And I'm flyin', but it's cool, I got insurance
On the run, because I got warrants 
But it's cool I got endurance
In school I got suspended, but in turn I got some earnings
Could've spent it all on Thursday, but I saved it for my parents
But I spent a bit on Friday, in the night I hang with Donald
And I'm tired of McDonald's, want a chick that cook Chicano
That can't speak a lick of English
And pronounce my name like "Chano"
She say "something, something" Spanish
I look back like, "Bitch, I-I know"
Toni-i-ight, I'mma make decisions for li-i-ife
Take some Lucys, Boomers
Dark liq' and lights, I might dri-i-ive
That's that shit right there that I don't li-i-ike
There, that shit, just had to say
Shouts to the niggas that passed away
And shouts for the niggas that's here right now
And shots at the niggas that got away
So sad to say, but it's all good
Niggas gon' celebrate, and wait for the day
And wait for the day shit detonate, with Alizé
Like live from the Chi', it's Saturday ni-i-ight
Used to have some patience, now it's all gone
Force feed these motherfuckers eatin' foie gras
Force feed these motherfuckers not a rockstar
I'm a say my piece, these other rappers lockjaw
I don't think they like me 
I don't think I'm icy, I think I'm aight, B

You got the power, you got the power
Of every hour,  of every hour
I come to getcha and I know where you are
I come to getcha and I know where you are
It's getting hot, it's like a sauna
Then every night, in Arizona
They come to getcha when they grope in your mind
They think you creepy, getting down in your mind
They come to getcha, they come to getcha
It doesn't matter, you making magic
I got the business to make a mind

Look what this feeling has done to me
There's something deep in the air
Just hope your hands lift me comfortably, oh
I don't know why but every time I see you smiling
I'm tired of running, tired of playing, tired of hiding
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And if it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
I think there's something for us
Lying around as the world comes down
If you understand what I'm saying
You won't end up in the lost and found, nope
I don't know why but every time I see you dancing
I'm tired of running tired of playing late romancing
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And if it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Now why can't every day be like this
Smoke a  J at the beach like this
Hang with bae at the beach like this
Conversations with Kish like this 
Never thought it could be like this
Be the man like I am like this
Dance around shake your hips like this
Mess around make a hit like this
Like this, like this, no
Always be like this, no
Like this, like this, like this, no
Always be like this, no
Like this, always be like this
Like this, like this, like thisCentrifugal force pulling me off-course, in a horse race
Changing horses midstream, fourteenth place
On videotape surveillance playback
Sigh you lose face, disgraced, God forbid you
Fall off of the face of the Earth to chase
The black hole of what you thought it was worth today
"Don't shoot the piano player" I heard them say
It was your fault, centrifugal force, you got caught
Convict monotonous, a verdict thoughtless
As you read it out loud, at least I was being relatively honest
Standing in your office trying to speak to some anacondas
Eking solace out of the sawdust
While your doppelganger stands topless
No one notices, they got their own dramas
Drama-rama's melodramas
You draw commas on the eyes of madonnas
And wonder why you can't turn traumas into nirvanas
Don't mess your head up, still run with these young bucks
Still runnin' on jet fuel, still pimpin' on what-what
What was I thinkin'? I wasn't; What am I drinkin'? I'm buzzin'
Speakin' of weekends I used to fuck with your cousin
I used to rap about nothin', now I rap about nothin'
But that nothin' was somethin' that ain't nobody was bumpin'
See I still got it boo-boo, just a dad'll do you
Wonders if you don't wanna be under some gross dude
But most girls will do it just for a corner seat at Nobu
I bet your daughter's perfect, he say it like he know you
My daughter isn't living yet, Atwater Village idiot
Their flow's dumb, but that royalty's the silliest, now
Someone tell these niggas I ain't fuckin' 'round
Fly them all to Vegas man we hold it down
Livin' for the present, nigga we fuck futures
Sippin' on some whiskey, these bitches drinkin' Kombucha
Recession means more oppression, these niggas will shoot ya
Rio de Janeiro, these bitches lookin' like Xuxa
Talk with anacondas, at least I'm bein' honest
I'm tryin' to turn these Keke Palmers into baby mamas
Baby mama, I'm your baby, mama
Man, let your boy drown, they ain't save me, mama
They ain't save me, mama
They ain't save me, mama
Silk pillow for that new weave
Silk pillow for that new weaveFirst Half
I ain't lovin' these fake hoes, room smellin' like 8 Swishers
Room service like 2K, NBA, I'm ballin', nigga
All them niggas, fallin' like Autumn, nigga
Talkin' shit, I saw them niggas, now their daughter want a picture
Rough ain't it? Fuck famous
Niggas too real, got the most haters
Wrote a story so Stephen Curry: how it feel to be golden?
Why was I chosen?
Hanalei Bay with my bae, what can I say?
I did it, my timin' was perfect, I'm comin', they know it
Becomin' the last great American poet
The flow Lindsay Lohan
Tired nigga, retire nigga
My word is art like a hieroglyphic
What island is this?
Cabernet, I can smell her talk
She wanna swim but can barely walk
She 'fraid of sharks, she'd hate my lawyer
Atlanta, Georgia, got somethin' for yah
I'm doin' somethin', stay wit' it
I sport the Oakland A fitted
Cause it's moneyball and I'm throwin' funny
But all the kids'll go get it
God dammit I'm ill
I got one question for the haters, is your girl on the pill?
I'm playin' though, but like really, really?
Second Half
Oh man
Oh man, oh man, oh man

Ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba
B-ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba
Na-na-di-ma-ma-ma
I love you all the time
Somethin' like that
I'm the man forever
They can't let a nigga live cause the life is better
85 everyday, why'd I bring this sweater?
I fell asleep on the beach, tiny pink umbrella
Fell out of my drink, she yellin', "What we doin' tonight?"
50k their first week, you ain't doin' it right
Young Bino best friends with the show promoters
Good year, my career is floatin', it's all me
Cause I stay real, the worst pain, niggas don't feel
Cause they ain't feel a nigga, tried to kill a nigga
But he still went stupid
Silver stones on her and the game so clueless
These niggas ain't us
Hopin' that I diss you back so I can make you famous
I'm just tired of haters
The AK goin' off, sound like cicadas
We the clique all day, man I'm so Decatur
Me and Fam backstage, yeah I know you hate us
But you gotta pay us
Let 'em speak at my peak in the game for a minute
But I don't know how
All these light skinned niggas came back in style
Ye lied to us, pretty girls at my concerts
Flow so cold so you know it was my verse
Stank attitude but I like the way she diddy bop
Puffin' white O's, body bang somethin' Nitty Scott
They want the old Bino so they try to rewind
The new Bino too ahead of his time
In a couple of years, they'll have to say I birthed a couple careers
Chances are I get your boy a couple of ears, you know it
Ba-b-ba-b-ba-ba
Duh-d-duh-duh-d-duh
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh
To love you all the time

To love you all the timeD-Money, D-Money, D-Money, D-Money
D-Money ho 
All we do is tell 'em so
Why we look professional
And you look like a talent show? 
All we do is bank, royalty forever and
Find a bad bitch, bring her home like a veteran 
Make her waffles , with pecans
I'm eatin' , one free hand
Been sayin' that we roll with the illest
Like roaches in the kitchen, go and watch a nigga kill it
I'm a P-I-M-P, why we spelling?
'Cause there's K-I-Ds around me 
DeKalb County, where you at? 
If you wit' me, holla back

Then she blow my K-Ci
And Jojos, where the fuck my money at? 
In the hood like I'm fixin' a Pontiac 
On deck wit' a gang of black Kennedies
Eight goons and they all got felonies 
Still gettin' money like white folks 
Still got quotes like Geico
I don't know French, that's "ma faute" 
Never not funny like fat jokes
(Like when someone is like, "What happened to Chris?"
And you- you turn around and there's a fat guy that kind of looks like Chris
And you like, "Oh shit" and you start laughin' and shit)
And I'm back in this bitch
And I'm black and I'm rich
And I'm cashin' it in for some passion and sin 
For some action with them, yeah 
Got a stank ho wit' me
Drivin' around and I run the whole city 
Everybody know she got tig ol' bitties
But nobody cares like it's J. Cole, Diggy

Lame song they play on, that play on

On my shit, on my dick
I can't wait
Toe to toe, I bang shit 
Homophobes on gay shit 
You don't know the hoes I hang with
My bungalow's like Vegas
Had a couple million but I put them in her stomach 
She like, "Oh my God, I'm coming" 
I kiss her neck and she love it 
Yeah we got a safe word , but we never use it
Man, I'm hidin' all these bruises 
In a shirt I got from Houston 
Got her usin' the acoustics
In my cruiser's new Isuzu 
And who knew  I'd be on Hulu
With two dudes I used to Google

I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you
If you point a gun at my rising sun
Though we're not the one
But in the bounds of your mind
We have done the crime
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
With a gun in your hand
I'm the boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you
Every boy and girl all around the world
Knows my nigga's words
But if he's scared of me
How can we be free? Yeah
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?I'm afraid of the future
I'm afraid my parents won't live long enough to see my kids
I'm afraid my show will fail
I'm scared my girl will get pregnant at not the exact time we want
I'm scared I'll never reach my potential
I'm afraid she's still in love w/ that dude
I feel like I'm letting everyone down
I'm afraid people hate who I really am
I'm afraid I hate who I really am
I'm scared people will find out what I masturbate to
I'm afraid I'm here for nothing
I feel that this will feel pretentious
I'm scared I'll never grow out of Bro Rape
I'm afraid people think I hate my race
I'm afraid people think I hate women
I hate people can say anything
I hate caring what people think
I'm afraid there's someone better for you
Or me
I'm afraid this is all an accident
I'm scared I'll be Tyrese
I'm afraid Dan Harmon hates me
I'm scared I won't know anything ever again
I'm scared I never knew anything
I'm afraid I'll regret this
I'm afraid this doesn't matter at all
I didn't leave Community to rap
I don't wanna rap
I wanted to be on my own
I've been sick this year
I've seen a bunch of people die this year
This is the first time I've felt helpless
But I'm not on that
Kept looking for something to be in with
Follow someone's blueprint. But you have to be on your own
The label doesn't want me to release in December because it's not a holiday record and I'm not a big artist. I started the record last Christmas. Christmas always made me feel lonely, but it helped me restart the new year. I want people to this album when everything's closed. When everything slows down and quiet.  So you can start over
I got really lost last year. But I can't be lonely tho. Cause we're all here
We're all stuck here
I wanted to make something that says, no matter how bad you fuck up, or mistakes you've made during the year, your life, your eternity. You're always allowed to be better. You're always allowed to grow up. If you wantTurn that beat up for me
Really everything, like the headphones
Yeah, yeah, a little bit louder
No punch, you know that mean that we workin' hard
Look, young rich nigga shit, pops was an immigrant
Lifestyle ill legit, but know I own businesses
Started out the trunk, ended up at the dealership
All gold Rollie, black face no blemishes
Legend in my city cause I grind so vigorous
If I show my face west of Texas, that's a big event
Gotta pay me twenty cents just to hear me vent
I'm really out here on some shit, you should take a flick
Ballin' on my own ten toes, so the difference is
I call shots never ask for permission, man
I got a lot of big plans in my vision and
I ain't failed yet, 'bout a dollar hell yes
I'm a problem-filled test, it's only getting worse
I swear I'm getting money, I just hope you gettin' yours
I'm killin' niggas solo so you know I'm gettin' more

Hostile, nigga my style
Kind of flow to paint a picture, Norman Rockwell
I don't eat pasta, everything is low-carb
I don't fly coach now, say I fly Goyard
Leave a face covered in that coast guard
Metaphor Mozart, all we do is tell 'em the truth
M Fox to my people on some family ties
Magazines got black faces when somebody dies
I mean look at Donna Summers, she was tryin' to survive
People wrestle over petty cash
When we should be really cryin' over that one percent
Like we tipped a milk glass
Fuck y'all, I'ma let my grandkids ball
Look to the future, these dudes so last week

Me and Nipsey on some grown shit, no rent
Own shit, so Jim Crow shit, black faces
Ay, nigga, black faces
Black faces
That's royalty, niggaDigital, Childish Gambino
Mixtape demonstrations
This Oxycontin carbon monox' and toxic concoction
Collapse your brain cells, they swell from lack of oxygen
Leave the opposition stuck, without a pot to piss in
Hockin', spitting up blood, shark by sharp precision
Dart incision, darkness imparts your vision
Sparks infliction,  I'm a mad magician
Verbal plasma, verbal scatter, words that shatter
Every atom in your body, now you're anti-matter
Ripping through the data, checked into the doctor
Took his rhyme splatter, cause my mind's faster
You falling down to ground, while I climb the ladder
Too much garbage in your gallbladder, fall flatter
On your face, now you carry by the pall-bearer
Or wear the black suit, eyes all teared up
Oh no, when your ho make a boss lit up
We in the rib with a smirk nigga, all geared up

Saving all my money just to waste on a bracelet
Can't see them haters, we don't give a fuck though
Charge it to the game, keep a lame so cutthroat
Never slip a fast one, the game is so in front of me
Travel 'round the globe, spend and make 'bout a 100 G's
Pack them crowds up, boss like Bowser
Deep pocket poetry, my custom trousers
Thank God they found us, the game was starvin'
I'm clean and concrete, you ass and Charmin
Bobby Digital, do you really think these niggas know shit?
Shopping in Manhattan and I ran into my old chick

Call 'em while I'm drifting off, tell her that I love her so
Parents crying harder cause I didn't even leave a note
Saying that I'm selfish and I'm sorry that I left
But it hurts so much to wake up and I left you guys a check
Cause I ain't fucking happy, you don't know shit about me
I think it started when she said she happier without me
I really can't blame her cause I'm happier without me
I don't see what girls are seeing when they say they're all about me
I'm scared they wanna trap me, these hoes are all liars
I double bag my shit and never cum while I'm inside her
I used to be a sweet dude, now I'm so angry
Look at what these girls and these fake niggas made me
Cry when I'm writing, I don't really know why
I think its cause I can't really see myself an old guy
And that scares me, I wanna be around a while
But I feel my purpose goes beyond having raised a child
Bright lights, they tend to burn out fast
So I shine bright, But I'm scared that it won't last
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, Imma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all
I'm just about the pop, the industry just noticed it
People watching me, I feel like Amber Rose's tits
Friends of mine are over it, people say I changed
And I tell them that I'm glad, cause I don't wanna stay the same
Cause I used to be poor, I used to be unconfident
I used to hate these haters, now its just the opposite
Not only have I changed, I'm becoming something better
And revenge is for the weak, so I have settled my vendettas
With all of the kids who made my early life a living hell
And I hope you're doing well and feeling better 'bout yourself
Don't know if you can tell, but change is usually for the better
I used to like these bitches but couldn't afford to get em
But now I'll take your girl, yeah player pay homage
That's why I fuck these bad mamas, Kate Gosselin
I'm trying to tell the world I'm nothing to be trifled with
Donald Glover staying hotter than some rifle spit
They only wanna fuck with you after you made your way
But when you started out you couldn't pay em to stay
But now I got em lined up in the lobby door
It makes me wonder what this rapping shit's a hobby for
Oh thats right, because I'm gifted in another field, and another field, and another field
They say my public persona don't have enough appeal
I take a lesson from Kanye and give em something real
I'm getting all this attention I wanna do it right
That's why I'm performing for you like every single night
To all my fans who's saying Donald Glover about to blow
Just give me six months so you can say I told you so
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, Imma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at allI'm the last of a dying breed
Meaning that I’m not afraid to try a new thing
Can't see me, best to get yourself some Visine
Toe tag a motherfucker
No jokes while these other niggas "wakka wakka"
Other rappers try and go and get over
You want that hood shit? Best to go and call Hova
I was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder
98 test score in my ThunderCat folder
My cousin was older, my mama used to wake up
Drive me to his school 'cause his school was much safer
But I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher
Now I'm going to a school where I get beat up
Because I ain't get down with them other kids
Probably 'cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there
Mama couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there
Guest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom
Now I'm going to this school called Rockbridge
School of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in
There's not a lot of black kids
So I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne
But really, what I wanna know is why I never fit in right
Like a fat dude getting on a packed flight
Even when I make friends in the hallways
I'm wishing I was someone else always
But I'm happy that that shit happened to me
'Cause it taught me most important is to do me
'Cause everybody hates you till they love you
Facebook niggas same niggas that would shove you
'Cause nobody was jocking my style
'Cause I had a high voice, they called me faggot 8 Mile
So I stopped writing for a very long time
Thinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes
And this next part, sounds like nonsense
But I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence
Taught me everything that is good comes from honesty
Everybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it
She on her role model shit
From the day that I shook her hand
I knew that I'd never die a broke man
So I could try this rapping shit out again
The game need change, I'm a part of it
People tell me I should spit under Donald Glover
But I try to keep my real name undercover
'Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes
And I can't go for that, nigga; Hall and Oates
My nigga stay down like a winter coat
I rap about my life, not "I'm On a Boat"
'Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand
Only ones who do it well's Lonely Island
Save the raps about your cat, I am not a fan
Leave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here
I do not play around with this bullshit
I am different, call it new shit
Labels want me to hurry and cash my check in
But I keep my shit free till the last possible second
'Cause God knows that I don't need the money
You get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?
But this limelight burn like a muh'fuck
I wanna call my dad crying but I hang up
'Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit
So I send him a check and tell him to hold it
If anything ever happens, want you to know this
I always took the time to smell the roses
And wherever I am, I am doing fine
I'm here for a good, not a long, timeAs time goes on 
Your talk keeps getting smaller 
As Childish lives in his short shorts,
He's got no time for your short money!
Two gold chains and I still don't never wear 'em
Why would I wear 'em? Cheese like a camera
Spendin' money son a bitch nigga like Sanford
I'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like 'Damn, I'm so handsome'
If it ain't 'bout that money, why a young god answer?
Ghost on my wrist , got me so Casper
Flow so cold, watch them haters get asthma
And every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk

Three cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em
Why would I call 'em?  Bitch you know I'm ballin'
Spendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding 
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans
And he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin'
All my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy
Rap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy
I got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Young Bino, we be mobbin'
You don't see me, I'm on an island
These haters left us no choice
Leave the trap like so moist
Little rock like dope boys
Oh my God, I'm out of fucks
Colombian but she ain't a plug
That's racist
In '96 I had K-swiss
You 96 with some fake bitch
And I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language
Head game so Cambridge
God damn, you dirty...
You were lettin' me bust in it
But if they ask I plead the fifth
Ok this the part where I need ya'll to make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk

Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talkThis is Royalty
Bang bang
I got yo bitch layin' naked 'cross the bed, no rosary
Stackin' up this bread like a baker, Josephine
She wanna refill, so I get that ho a bean
Niggas on the sideline yellin' "Who the fuck is he?"
Bitch I'm @Gonage, you can call me Cody B
Wardrobe overseas, passports all over me
White leather seats lookin' like coca leaf
Every time I crank up the woofer sittin' on a key
I'm Gucci buckled up, house note on my feet
Linen button-up like I'm walkin' round on the beach
Blind hoes notice me in my Range Rover Jeep
So they wanna come and talk to me like Jodeci
Smokin' in the morning, and when I go to sleep
Blowin' presidential man, I think they 'about to vote for me
Any event we party like a frat, no toga sheet
If money ain't the convo, they ain't even 'posed to speak
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment
If you talkin' money, I can make arrangement
Cody
Cody Bean Senior, pushin' mean ether
You don't know Childish? Nigga, me neither
Eastside Atlanta, flyest nigga in a Waffle House
If it ain't money, man, we ain't got shit to talk about
Kennedy compound, my 20-room house
So big my ex-girls ain't gotta move out
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
My bank account looking like when little kids break shit—"Oooh!"
If I'm breathin' I can handle it
Watching all my dreams get together like an ampersand
Blueprint the new shit, mixtape management
Show these dummies how to do it, all I want's my ten percent
Porsche brand new, passed 'em a cool hundred
Yeah my girl 5'2", even her growth stunted
It's the nigga y'all knew back when I flipped meal cards
Now my meals free when I don't taste the fifth star
We can make arrangements, old money Cambridge
Meetin' with the moguls, make 'em richer and they owe you
It's the kid you used to talk about, I'm watchin' people get up on it
On Worldstar and I ain't have to have a nigga moment
Flow's always cold, keep the whole soul anemic
Never left that hard shit, a nigga's always constipated
Got the change for my cousin on froze, no more movin' weight
Flossin' hard, ice king, no more Finn and Jake
Love or hate you gotta say the hype is something handsome
As long as all of 'em bloggin' I'm living Richard Branson
Shit talk is still talk, haters are my billboard
Used to take the Q home, now I hang with ScHoolboy
So iconic, Black Kennedy this shit
Man I'm so ironic, man this ratchet need a fix
Droppin' new shit and the haters get the splashback
Don't be surprised when he ask you where the cash at
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment

CodySeven billion people
Tryna free themselves
Said a billion prayers
Tryna save myself
I can see it coming
But it's moving fast
Been through a hurricane
With the sunroof down
Dancing with no pain
We wait to see the sunrise
It's a holiday 
When you're around 
Breath of fresh air like a cold winter breeze
And I can feel it slow down, oh
Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time
Oh, time, time, yeah
Running after something
But I don't know what
Am I running to?
Too afraid to stop
Hundred miles an hour
With no seatbelt on
Time is everlasting
I can't wait that long 
Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams 
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems 
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow 
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time
My feet are falling to the bottom of the ocean
Running out of time, out of time, uh, oh yeah
High on emotion, I can feel it moving forward
Running out of time, running out
Running out, running out of time
Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams 
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems 
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow 
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time
Uh
It's about power 
All about power 
Oh, I'm in time
I'm just tryna feel it 
Get a little bit stronger
Gotta go all out 
A nigga gon' ball out
Try not to fall out
Tryna be better
Gotta get better 
Too many pressure
Nigga need pressure
People need pressure
Uh, woo
Running out of time
We're running
Running out of time 
We're running
Running out of time
We're runningRAP GENIUS NOTE: This is Part 2 of the script, read Part 1 if you have not already

**************
The Boy lies, arms to his side, on his bed, looking at the ceiling
Spiders slowly drop from single strands of web from all the posts on the bed. It looks pretty. All of them dropping simultaneously swaying together. They whisper:
......where are you?
................who is this?
...don't slide
It's almost a song
**************
INT. MANSION - NIGHT
More people are at the house. People drinking and smoking. Shoes off. It's a Temple. Respect it
The back wall of the living room has been pushed into the wall, so there's a seamless transiting from living room to backyard patio
People sit on the swings underneath space heaters
EMILY is in the middle of the pool table. Swank plays pool around her. RUBEN is filming Marcus and Steve throwing things in the fire pit
AJ is djing in the middle of the living room
Some guy is running through the living room in just a towel. He is dripping water. He almost slips
The projector room  is playing Fight/Vine compilations. Two dudes are in there not watching. Just smoking
The Boy walks through the backyard. There's a dude and a girl making out on the bar outside. They're sitting on the bar
       THE BOY: Don't sit on that
They look at him. He stares back. They get down. He walks away. They stare as he leaves. The Boy walks to the edge of the pool and looks at the ocean go into the sky
       THIS KID IN A HAT : Hurry!
This kid in a hat and his friend are running out the front door with an iPad and a midi controller. The Boy walks inside. Marcus stops him. He's out of breath and looks wet
       THE BOY: Some guys just stole some stuff
       MARCUS: Please tell me you saw that Argentinan...Argentinian? Argentina-girl. I can't say it-
       THE BOY: Stop inviting random niggas in here. If you don't know their names they can't come
       MARCUS: I don't hear you right now. I just fucked in a steam shower and I feel CRAZY. It's like I came in a Prince video. I like, blacked out. Couldn't breath in there, mane. I-  Fuck! Is she still in there? You think she's okay? 
       THE BOY: You're the Florida of my friends
The Boy walks away
INT. FATHER'S ROOM - NIGHT
The Boy walks up to the door. Before he can open it, Sasha opens it from the inside. She's with another girl. It feels like they just did a drug or were stealing something themselves
Sasha sees The Boy. Startled. Then she smirks
       SASHA: Come in! Quick!
She pulls him in. The other girl flops on the bed
       OTHER GIRL: UUUUUGGGGHHHHHHH. SOOOOO SOOOOOFFFFTTT
       SASHA: Hurry, hurry, hurry. Scoot, scoot
The Boy lays against the wall. Sasha sits on the bed
Silence. Then:
       SASHA : Show us your dick
       THE BOY: Wha?
       SASHA: Do it. Show it
       OTHER GIRL: Ew
Silence
       THE BOY: Ha
Silence
       THE BOY : Why?
       SASHA: Cause it's probably gross and I wanna laugh at it
       OTHER GIRL: I've never seen a black dick. Is it purple?
       SASHA: Grape dick
       OTHER GIRL : Grape dick
Sasha gets up and starts to punch The Boy playfully. The other girl is laughing crazy
       SASHA: Do it. Don't be weird!
       OTHER GIRL: Let's be weird a little!
The punches slowly stop. Then Sasha starts kissing The Boy. You can't see below their waist, but stuff is going on. Then stuff stops
       SASHA: What's wrong? This is weird?
       THE BOY: No
       SASHA: You don't want to? This is weird?
       THE BOY: No. I want to
       SASHA: Then...what's going on, chum?
       THE BOY: Hold on
The Boy plays with his dick. Nothing. It's like gum
Silence. Fidgeting. Sasha's got a  look on her face
       THE BOY : Hold on
He walks into the bathroom and closes the door. Locked. Silence. Sasha sits on the floor
       OTHER GIRL: What's up?
**************
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
The Boy sits on the floor. Head in hands
Damn, guy
The Boy's ex-girlfriend steps out of the linen closet
       VANESSA: What are you doing?
       THE BOY : Chillin
       VANESSA: In the Bathroom?
       THE BOY: Mmm-hmm
       VANESSA: Well, I want to go out
       THE BOY : Mmm-mmm
Vanessa playfully throws things from the counter at him . He throws some of it back. She starts laughing. He pulls her to the ground with him
       VANESSA: Why are you so moody?
       THE BOY: I'm not. Let me enjoy this for a second
       VANESSA: We can do this outside, 
       THE BOY: We could live the rest of our lives here. There's a TV in the mirror. There's fresh water every time we flush. I heard they're building a sandwich place in the shower
Vanessa smh and smiles
       VANESSA: Get up. We're going
       THE BOY: Come 'on-
       VANESSA: I mean it!
She pulls him up. She opens up the linen closet and pulls The Boy in
Coachella is inside the closet
There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose today. It's a great time
The Boy chases after Vanessa and catches her. He carries her for like three steps, then they walk together, holding hands
       VANESSA : We have to see everything together. I don't wanna split up this time. We each get to choose one band the other one can't make you see-  What's wrong?
       THE BOY : ...
       VANESSA : Really?...You're really doing this to me? Right now?
       THE BOY: You don't think this is a waste of our time?
       VANESSA: No, I don't think me and you together is a waste of time. That's what you think. And I'm tired of trying to convince you otherwise. At least be a man and break up with me instead of telling me I don't like you
       THE BOY: But you don't! You don't really like me. I just look good when you scroll past me with the rest of your "I'm almost Vashtie" bullshit
       VANESSA : You're so mean
       THE BOY: I'm trying to be honest
       VANESSA: Mean doesn't mean honest! Honest can mean mean. But only if you mean it
       THE BOY : Wait...the-
       VANESSA: I'm trying so hard with you. But I'm not gonna carry us. I won't waste your time anymore
She starts walking away. Then she looks to the sky and shoots up like a rocket
She looks like a shooting star in the sky. Not a sound is heard while this happens. They never see each other again
Then the coyotes come out
They're glowing blue. They're circling and they're talking about music
       WOLF 1: What'd you think of 2 Chainz' set?
       WOLF 2: It was really fun. His live shows have gotten way better. I saw him last spring in Chicago
       WOLF WITH GLASSES: Have you heard that Roc Marciano album on vinyl? It's so good, man
       MESSY, BUT COOL WOLF: You guys, this is my fiance, another wolf. He or she works in a small music or graphic design for niche clothing or this app I'm building
They rip The Boy to shreds while they talk. Blood everywhere. The Boy doesn't make a sound. Lets it happen
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
The Boy realizes he is pacing in the shower. He's been in there for a minute, cause the water is cold
He opens the door. The girls are gone. The small clock on the desk says "5:23 AM". There's also a note written in lipstick on the mirror that says "YOUR FUCKED" . Probably Sasha. She's probably right
CUT TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The house isn't totalled, just dirty. Empty cups, bottles, cigarette butts, etc. The Boy sees Steve and Swank passed out on the couch
       THE BOY: Let's go guys
       STEVE : Where we going?
       THE BOY: Oakland
       SWANK: When's the flight leave?
       THE BOY: We're driving
       SWANK: Wha?  How'd we get poor?
INT. FAM'S ROOM - NIGHT
Fam's sleeping. There's a naked girl sleeping with him. The Boy comes in
       THE BOY: We're going
The Boy leaves. Fam opens his eyes
CUT TO:
**************
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
Swank, Steve, and Fam are asleep in the car. The Boy sits down in the driver's seat
       He pulls out his phone and texts someone named NYALA:
Im driving up now
...
       She writes back: DONT
The Boy looks at this. Then starts up the car and turns on the radio and speeds out of the driveway
A moment passes...
Then we see the girl that was in bed with Fam walk out in the Mansion doorway
       THAT GIRL FAM KNOWS FROM THAT ONE PLACE: Fam?
EXT. I-5 - NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
Everyone's asleep in the car except The Boy who's driving . Lloyd's "Oakland" is playing on the radio. The Boy turns it up so he feels like he's in a video. He pushes his seat back so he can lean
       SWANK: Ow, ow!
He slammed Swanks knees. Sorry
The Boy speeds through the empty highway. It's really pretty. I'm not sure what those factories are in the middle of nowhere with all the lights on them. They're probably horrible for the earth, but they look really magical at night. He passes one of those factories
There's a lot of rolling hills. Lotta farms. There's a slaughterhouse. Smells and looks grey and awful. All the cows look really sad. Maybe I'm just making them sad. Maybe they're fine
Looking at the rows of crops criss-cross on farms as they pass
There's a billboard. It says: ROSCOE'S WETSUIT
The Boy stares at it. Just a white billboard with "roscoe's wetsuit" on it
EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN-N-OUT - DAY
The guys are sitting on their car, eating burgers at the far end of the parking lot
As The Boy bites into his double-double he thinks about the slaughterhouse. Then he looks at his burger. He laughs
Two women walk out. They look like they're in their late 30s. Swank spots em. One of the women is wearing a Northwestern hoodie
       SWANK : Long way from Chicago
       WOMAN 1: Alumni
       SWANK: There's no way. You can't be over twenty-three
The women just smirk and close their doors. They drive off
       SWANK : See that? Johnny Appleseed of confidence, man. Just leaving little seeds with everyone
A car crazily pulls up next to the In-N-Out. Two dudes jump out with masks and guns
       FAM: Daaammmmnnn
They run inside. We see people running in their cars, and driving off. All of our guys stay seated on their car. Just eating
A minute goes by. No gun shots. Just yelling
The two dudes run out. Just as they do, you can hear the police coming
       ROBBERY DUDE 1: MOVE, RYAN!
       AJ: This nigga's using his real name. Treated
       STEVE: Could be a code name
       AJ: That's definitely his real name. No one's robbery name is "Ryan". It's something like..."Snake-Man"
They all make a face
       AJ : Fuck ya'll. I wouldn't rob a place with ya'll pussy ass anyway
The Police roll up. Ryan tries to get away, but they pin him. The other dude shoots at the cop
       FAM: We should leave. They're shooting at the cops. Which means the other cops coming give a fuck 'bout bystanders now
       MARCUS : Two men were arrested in an attempted robbery at an In-N-Out burger today.  Also some niggers ended up dead, we don't know. This is news, people!
       STEVE: After being frisked, the dead suspects somehow got guns and shot themselves in the head even though they were handcuffed and in the back of a tiny-ass squad car
       THE BOY: Police chief states: "no investigation needed"
       STEVE: "White people still safe!"
They laugh. As they start to drive off
Suddenly two cop cars screech in front of them
       COP 1: HANDS IN THE AIR!
       STEVE: Fuck
All of the guys put their hands up
CUT TO:
EXT. OAKLAND STREET - DAY
Everyone looks a little bummed. Silence. More silence
       THE BOY: We're here
They pull over to a row of brownstones
       MARCUS: Great. Why are we where is this?
The Boy gets out of the car and walks up to the door. As he's about to knock, the door opens. Nyla is standing there. Her face is a mix of anger and strange
Sympathy. Like she refused to cry like...an hour ago?
       THE BOY: Hey-
       NYLA: There's a point you reach when you're no longer able to feel like you did. Not about a person, not with a certain place, you just can't feel like you did because that muscle or whatever is just...dead. Or gone
       THE BOY: Hi, Nyla
       NYLA: When you're alone, you might be able to remember it. You might even hear a song that makes you question it. But you don't have it. It doesn't exist anymore. It's dead. Do you understand?
       THE BOY: Yes. Absolutely. But Nyla-
       NYLA: I AM AT THAT POINT, 
Tears. She's not crying. She's just that mad
A dude pokes his head out from the hallway in the brownstone. The Boy and him make eye contact
       THE BOY: This isn't what you think it is. I didn't come here to...look, I saw this dude die and-
       NYLA: And you're scared. So you came here
       THE BOY: I'm not scared. I just wanna be with someone
Who knows me for a little
       NYLA: I don't know you. We're not together. I have company. Go home
       THE BOY: Okay, you're being mean now
       NYLA: "Mean?" Who cares? You're an adult. Also, you embarrassed me
       THE BOY : We were planning on having a kid together. She offered and we had a whole plan. Like adults or something. Then I backed out. So...  You're second at best is what I'm saying
The guy goes -__- 
       NYLA: What is wrong with you?
       THE BOY: I don't know
       NYLA: Me neither
This is really sad for both of em. They really wanna know. Nyla closes the door
       NYLA : Please grow up
The Boy stands there...then Swank walks up to him on the stoop of the brownstone
       SWANK: Can I use her bathroom? That double-double's makin moves
The Boy walks away and gets in the car. Swank stands there for a moment. Then tries to cut off a fart with his hand as he walks to the car
CUT TO:
**************
INT. OAKLAND CLUB - NIGHT
The guys sit at a table in the corner. The Boy is sitting in the corner. Fam is texting. Swank and Steve are talking to two girls. A promoter walks over
       PROMOTER: Ey. You gonna just sit here
       THE BOY: Yeah
       PROMOTER: Well, you gotta order something
       THE BOY: A bottle?
       PROMOTER: Yeah. A bottle
They stare
       THE BOY: I'll take 12 bottles
Promoter gives him a . The Boy just stares at him...he's serious. The promoter walks off
CUT TO:
Twelve girls with bottles and sparklers emerge around the club from the back. It's a parade. They curve around the club making a big to do. People are staring, like "is Diddy here? OMG Diddy's here!"
The parade gets to the top of the stairs where the booth is. But when they turn the corner, the guys are gone already. There's a stack of cash sitting in the middle of the table
The promoter stands there
INT. DINER - LATE NIGHT
The guys are eating
       SWANK: But animals eat animals, man. Animals!
       STEVE: The argument is that we've been given the freewill and understanding of life. So we shouldn't because the option is there for us
       SWANK: Man, in Nigeria they made me AND my little brother slaughter a goat. We raised that goat, man. I loved that fucking goat. And one day we came home from school and they just handed us the knife. I've seen the blood man. I've heard the screams. I still ate the shit though
...I was here before
       THE BOY: We were here before
       FAM: What?
       THE BOY: We've done this before
       FAM: Nah man. This is our first time together in Oakland
       THE BOY: This is every night. This is all the nights, man
       FAM : Nahhhh. We switch it up, man
The Boy stops listening. Across the way there's a group of kids eating in a booth
They're laughing and talking behind the back of a friend they don't seem to like very much. One of the girls is going in. But behind her, there's a guy in a colorful faux 90's hat. He's writing something on the wall in sharpie
He's writing "roscoe's wetsuit"
The Boy gets up and walks over
       THE BOY: Excuse me. What does that mean?
       HAT KID: What?
       THE BOY: Roscoe's wetsuit
       HAT KID: Oh. I don't know
       THE BOY: Yes you do
       HAT KID: Wha?
       THE BOY: You know what it means. Tell me
       HAT KID: I don't know. I saw it online
       THE BOY: So you just write shit you see?
       HAT KID: Fuck's your problem?
Fam walks up. Grabs The Boy
       FAM: Ey. Let's just eat
The Boy and Fam sit
       HAT KID: It means I sat on your mom's face
The Boy SLAMS his fist on the table. It's loud. Everyone in the diner looks at him. The Boy doesn't look up
       THE BOY : Tell me what it is or I'll cut you open and take the answer
Silence
CUT TO:
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
The guys roll up to the front of the hotel
       SWANK: That kid was scared as fuck! He was like 
       FAM : You good?
Boy doesn't say anything
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
The guys walk in the lobby. There's an Indian wedding happening. They're probably not called Indian weddings. It's probably just a wedding, but all the people participating happen to be Indian. There's a bunch of guys talking and quietly laughing in the hall. The door to the banquet room is open as they pass. The Boy stops. The bride and groom are slow dancing. The Bride is quite pretty. Green eyes and dark skin. She's got the aura of a business woman. Probably met him at Stanford and was like "this is reliable". The groom looks like a caricature of a good ol' fashion white dude
       STEVE: Good for him
       SWANK: Nah. He don't get any interracial points. He's just doing what white guys been doing since forever. Exactly what he wants
       AJ: Really? Like that?
       SWANK: Man, I used to get so pissed when girls would watch Boy Meets World and be like "Ryder Strong's so dope for having a black girlfriend". Man, fuck that nigga
       AJ: Come on, man. My dad's white and his parents didn't like my mom. They just started talking again
       SWANK : Oh you're poor white dad!  Nigga, shut up. Take that team light skin shit outside
       THE BOY: I've never seen one of these
       FAM: A first dance?
       THE BOY: A wedding
       FAM: Yeah.  Marriage is so wack. I mean, I get it. But come on, yo. Forever?  Forever, ever? Forever, ever?
       THE BOY: You think either of them don't wanna do it?
       FAM: Mane, I bet both of em are like that
       THE BOY: They look happy as fuck though
       FAM: Cause they reached their goal. In a year they'll
Be like "oh fuck...goals are dumb."
       MARCUS: Goals are dumb?
       FAM: Making your life a goal is dumb. I think. This shit is supposed to be just fun.  I took an edible at the diner. It's kickin in. Hard. I'mma go upstairs
       THE BOY: Okay
They both stand there for a moment
       FAM: I'm gonna need some help
AJ takes Fam by the arm
       FAM : There we go
They head to the elevators
       MARCUS: I'mma look for some bridesmaids
He walks off
       STEVE : Gee-van-chi!
       MARCUS : Nigga, god bless you
       STEVE : What you doin?
The Boy stares at the couple
       THE BOY: I'mma stay down here
       SWANK: You good?
       THE BOY: I'm great
They Kanye shrug, then walk off to the bar. The Boy walks into the banquet
INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
The lights are low. Most of the people have gotten up to pee or something. The Boy just stares at the couple. Then he decides to start recording. A man comes up to him
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE:Who are you here with?
       THE BOY : The groom. We went to college together
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Oh.  Nice isn't it?
       THE BOY : Beautiful
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: When the buddies start getting
Married, that means you're next
       THE BOY: I don't think so
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: That's what everyone says. That's what I said thirty years ago
       THE BOY: I don't believe in marriage.  Maybe that's not true. But I am against it
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: What do you believe in?
       THE BOY: Cool baby mamas
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Ahhhhh. But how many women you know are interested in your concept?
       THE BOY: More than you'd think. I find if you have a job and are actually interested in raising a child, women, who are a little older, tend to be responsive. I just don't think they like being labeled that.  Do you get tired of it?
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Of marriage?
       THE BOY: Of marriage. Of her. Of yourself
He thinks
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Yes. Sometimes
       THE BOY: Then why?
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: I had to man-up. It was time. I
Don't regret it
       THE BOY: Well I don't have to man-up. I did what I'm supposed to do. I found the things I'm good at. I didn't get anyone pregnant on the way there. And I've had mature relationships that prepared me for what marriage is
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Mature relationships?
       THE BOY: Yeah. I keep in touch with all my exes. We're all friends
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: You still call them
       THE BOY: I send em a happy birthday text or DM 'em
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: That's not a friend. I do that with my boss. And I hate my boss.  Fuckin Korean kid thinks he know everything
Silence
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE : What do you do?
       THE BOY: I troll celebrities, politicians, or anyone with large enough online cache until I get a response. I post those responses and/or convos on my blog. And I charge gossip blogs and advertisers to advertise on my site and sometimes me and my friend put out novelty books of fucked up things we find online while digging up dirt on said celebrities and/ or politicians and sell it to niche book stores or larger stores that fit our aesthetic
The man just stares, not understanding
       THE BOY : How old are you?
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Fifty-three
       THE BOY: I'm like Bill O'Reilly
       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Oh
The older man leaves. A shlubby man in a suit comes to the podium in front. People clap for the end of the dance
       MAN IN SUIT: I've known Safia and Greg since college and I honestly knew this day would happen since we were getting high in my dorm room junior year at GW.  Sorry Mrs. Healey, Greg smokes weed. You gotta deal!
Everyone laughs
       MAN IN SUIT : But honestly, may you two spend the rest of your lives healthy and happy
"Awwww"
       MAN IN SUIT : And now, the traditional "march to forever" to bless the bride and groom with happiness for all their days to come
Everyone claps
**************
Little creatures slowly start to march out from the kitchen. Some have banners that say "HAPPY MARRIAGE!". Some have sparklers. They all bounce on beat. It's cute for a very short moment. Then it feels wrong
All the creatures have two legs, two arms, like humans.  But they are definitely not humans. One of the giveaways being that they are naked, but don't seem to have genitals
All the creatures are breathing heavy out their mouths 
They're about three feet high. Their eyes are larger than they should be and are spread farther on their faces. They don't have hair anywhere on their bodies. They all have forced smiles on their faces. You can see their teeth are just a little too sharp when they smile. Insinuating carnivorous behavior. If they wanted to, at any point they could jump on you and rip out your throat in .8 seconds. But they're not right now. They're marching
One of the creatures has tears in its eyes. Still smiling tho. Pushing the smile
Everyone is smiling as they march past, but they're all very cautious. Clearly worried that one may attack. The Boy watches as the creatures reach the front of the party and form a circle. They do this weird clapping, almost step team routine, then stop. The music stops
       CREATURE 1: We did it!
       CREATURE 2: Yay!
Everyone claps. The bride and groom force a smile. The creatures slowly make their way back to the kitchen. All that's heard is their struggled breathing and clammy skin hitting the wooden dance floor. One stares at The Boy as he  leaves
...that was unacceptable.

Spitting at the crowd like I play heavy metal music

Keep it fresh to death, keep my swag inside a coffin
So fly, I'm in the sky like Vodka, partner
Shout out to Marc Jacobs, yeah, my feet be feeling highbrow

But now, they see we dangerous
Bring your girl around me, let me show her how her body work
She like me 'cause my wallet fat, it should wear a Hawaiian shirt
Comin' for your spot, like I do when I'm inside of her
Got the cold, hard green in my hand, no Heineken

Yea, candy
Uhh, where is this song in my Blackberry?
Yea, yea
Alright cool
Okay
As my mind run licking cotton candy lipstick
You're right here in my room, yeah I wished it
Candlelight vigil for the one you're texting
Pink sweatpants - hmm, interesting
No need, don't explain to me, love
Cause I know how you deal, but I could see us
In a different way, don't play me cause we're not the same
Sign on, sees your screen name and misbehave
So you're a playboy, you think you're Heff kid?
Hoppin' round town with the bunnies when
I'm the candy that you need, brush your sweet tooth
Heard you got me replaced with a statue?
A veneer, I hear, she's just swell
If you want to date a rock, you think I can't tell?
So you bored? Are you lost? Was it worthwhile?
I feel the ice-cold chill in her warm smile
Saw you last night, you didn't have to act foul
Come and sweep me from the back room
Feel my palms heat up on your chest now
As the night creeps into bedtime vows
Married in a white t-shirt, bed style
Still, you know that I'm the best ride
You deserve what you get: it's called respect
You ever heard of it?
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in the moonlight
I can fly away and make it go right
It go
It go
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
I used to front somethin' stupid, now I'm makin' them wait
Except for you mama, I'm ready, I don't wanna be late
Never hesitate, you know it, petty cash, we blow it
Excuse me for imperfect, them halfway looks is worth it
I watched these niggas lurkin', they just want my leftovers
Watching Locked Up all day and slept over
Put your hair back: Afro
Skippin' after-parties at the last show
I'mma hold your hand in little Tokyo
And tell you somethin' in your ear that you shouldn't know
Two jumps, but the feeling was so gone
High school swag, busy fuckin' with clothes on
Lost a couple words, joke around the reason
You can wear my shirt, pretend to let you win that FIFA
There was nothing like it...settle down
You always hit me when my boo around
It's a long walk - we ain't talkin', though
That ratchet ho on lock-n-load, I appreciate the offer, though
I'mma do it right - later, though
'Cause, either way, you're gonna hate me like you say you won't
Thank God for that - it's called regret
You ever heard of it?
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in the moonlight
I can fly away and make it go right
It go

I know what you're missing in your new life

This rapper's book, this writer's book
They kinda shook, it's not a hook
They kinda shook, it's not a hook
There's an edge to the wind
Cutting into my skin
And the air's like an icicle

Too difficult to figure out so little bloggers simmer down
Or you just might lose it
Have a seat, shut your mouth, turn us up
Take the thinking cap off, and enjoy the music

If I said to look away, would you turn around
And take me off the hit-list?
I don't think so
Are you mad right now? Yeah, I know
Go home, put your thumb in your mouth

I'm walking weird 'cause it's Walker that I'm wasted on
People just realizing that I'm awesome, why they take so long?
Skip around the album, it's not hard to find your favorite song
Pussy and these tracks the only things that I go crazy on
Let me slow it down a sec, man, I cannot not be sick
Hook me up with Dimetapp

This is not a joke. You won't listen to what I'm sayin'
And I promise to destroy any nigga who think I'm playin'
Know my verses can be silly, but I'm choosing not to spray rounds
My verse is pedophiles on the playground, okay now?
Half-price flat screens, yes, I work for Sony
I kiss her hard and hit the jet, I make out like a bandit
They trying hard to hate me, I just don't understand it
Screamin' at me, "When you gonna stick to the right business
And stop making rap music for these White kids-es?"
Huh, I make music for these tight kids
Don't be a fucking asshole, one day, you'll have to wipe his
I know what I am, and I'll never be hovy
'Cause I am just different, I'm being what I am, man
I don't need a Jesus piece, my jacket cost me 10 grand
I'm going light speed, and I don't care if you can't see us
'Cause I will never stop, like I am cruising in a Prius
You talk from far away because my money's between us
And I'm working hard as hell, until I'm chilling with Aaliyah
Bitch, you know me
BitchOkay whats up my nigga
Word up to seven figures
My swag is always capital, it live in north Virginia
Bino on that hood beat, yain't know he had it in him
Came on this beat, I ain't even buy it dinner
Slide inside the party late, leaving with the baddest ho
Whiskey shots and doin Asian bitches is the status quo
The future's always coming, whether clitoral or vaginal
Always in that pussy like my jacket made of calico
It's on, I made this shit for New Years
Play this shit at midnight, like TV shows with boobies
My asthma status chronic, you can get an ounce of that
Real G's only
Don't fuck up my alphabet
I'm as real as I'mma get, loser who got confident
Attracted to an awkward bitch, but mostly cause we're opposites
Blew up in 0-10 like tick, tick boom
No drugs at the club, I'mma slip shit through
Came hard on this bitch, and my dick did too
Here's a list of the shit I'm addicted to
Like, weed, whiskey, sometimes ex
But that is only when I'm drunk and call her up to have sex
These girls I’m fucking now see my dick as blank checks

Chris Brown pussy, it won't make it to the Grammys
Finally met your girlfriend, that is why her knees hurt
Been to hell and back and all I gots this fuckin T-shirt
Laughing while mackin these hoes
Vastly these rappers are slow
Asking to get back in the know
When they lacking a passionate flow
Trust in Gambino, he has never failed us

Ashy to classy, finally got some Vaseline
Live inside a sauna 'cause I always got my self-esteem
Name in your mouth, and it seems as though I struck a nerve
I never fit in like my penis in these tiny girls
I figured I was different from these other guys
When I wrote for 30 Rock, I was under 25
These other rappers wanna fade into the background

I remember, uh, back when I was six years old, uh
Daddy said, "The world's so cold"
"There is something that you should know"
Uh
"You're so gorgeous," thank you, daddy
"Nothing's really worth your time"
"But someday soon you just might find"
"The truth about the world's design," oh
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
No, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
And I know that, yeah
Now remember, uh
You do what the hell you want, uh
But someone's gonna smell your funk
You're exactly what they want 
To be happy really means that someone else ain't
And balance ain't a one-food plate
Everything is give and take, oh, oh
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
Oh, oh, yeah, oh yeah
To be beautiful is to be hunted

Can't get you used to this
No, no, no, no
To be beautiful is to be hunted 
I can't change the truth , I can't get you used to this
Ooh, give it to me now, bring the strings back, uh
To be beautiful is to be hunted
We are beautiful, yeah

They wanted something different, nigga problem solved
Drunk off the high life, death is when I sleep it off
Life's a hangover and this rappin' shit's my Tylenol
I could call any girl in my phone right now
Have a pillow in her mouth, watch her bite down
She like me cause I'm flier than a kite now
It's funny how I get these write ups on what I write down
Chick on my left arm, she could write The King And I
I'd rather die the truth, these niggas live a lie
Dressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized
See me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes
Always do me like I love self portraits
Now these fake niggas say "Hey" like horse shit
People treat me different but I'm still the same person
I don't know what it means, I just know that it's worth it
I know I'm not perfect, but I am original
Wallet stay healthy: vitamins, minerals
Gotta feed the bitch right, stuff her full of spinach
Facebook messages askin' how I did it
No time to respond, time is money, life's a debit card
Spend it on the right shit, these bitches want you overdrawn
Drake with dyslexia, I have gone so far
My life is a green light, I always try and go hard
I am just different
I am so different, the game's on lid eye
Listen to my mixtape, change your whole shit up
Salad backstage, I just wanna eat alone
Crowd at my shows more mixed than Rashida Jones
Haters say I'm changin', but I haven't changed at all
Indie kids saying that I've ruined all their favorite songs
Hood niggas sayin' that I'm whiter than that Colgate
Hatin' on my progress, I'm a long ways from Bro Rape
Black Clark Kent, all I need's a Lois Lane
But let her spend the night once and watch her go insane
Voice mail, e-mail, sendin' text message
We are not engaged just because I made breakfast
Believe me you don't want this, I'm all about business
Life is a bitch, I must be datin' her sisters
Gotta be different, take chances like pictures
Emerge victorious, stunt on y'all bitches
I'm not at the top, but ya'll niggas know I'm comin' fast
Rap will change after me, all of this will come to pass
Rappers start to use real instruments and shit
Niggas start to copy me, dumb it down and make it rich
I am not a novelty, just the first to do it different
I have always been this good, you were just laughing too hard to listen
Got my career overnighted, maybe you should order one
Springsteen this city 'cause this city we were born to run
I am just different
I am just different
I've always been different
I am just different]
Is it too much to ask for lyrics?

We can go to Saturn, it doesn’t really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try
Knock, knock, it’s me
I’ma take ya fine ass out to Applebee’s
Get anything you want, this shit is free
My friend work here
Whatcha mean, I ain’t romantic?
I bought you flowers, so what they plastic?
We could fuck for hours, so what, I’m nasty?
I ain’t got the roommate, that was my old place
I’ma take you to the crib and show you the ‘O’ face
You make me feel like I’m back in the 5th grade
Had a crush on Keana and she rocked the one braid
And I thought that sex was when you touched a girl’s butt
You could get a girl pregnant, so look, but don’t touch
I like you so much, I know it sound crazy
But I’d have a sex change just so I could have your baby
The roles are reversed, so you got a huge dick, and I got a Prada purse
A nigga so sick, that my car’s a doctor
Take a gamble on a nigga that your name was Proctor
Kick it in Chinese like you’re Shaolin soccer
Got nothin’ but dinero, so you meetin’ the Fockers
Look at my clock-ers, it’s time to roll out
Get sneaks, sneaks, and sneaks, and they sold out
That’s what I’m all about and if you got the time
It’s hard to make change when you want one dime
We can go to Saturn, it doesn’t really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try
Welcome back everyone to "Pinoys in Space"
Got a new constellation for you to trace
Use the far East star for your startin’ place
You see it? My big dipper's slappin’ you in the face
Step out of the shed, let the sun be felt
On your head as you undo Orion’s belt
Oh nuts! I just crashed landed on the planet of the gay cliché
Talkin’ Milky Way, bouquets, Broadway, bubblay and Michael Bublé
Sorry if I caught you off-guard with my five-second delay
But the jet-lag’s making me loopy and my sales are soupy
Soupy Sales! I eat chocolate!
We can go to Saturn, it doesn’t really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try
We can go to Saturn, it doesn’t really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try

Laughter that we ain't heard from children we ain't had
I'm a boss, homie. Die a boss like I'm Steve Jobs
They thought I was Jamaican, I got three jobs
They must have been mistaken, I ain't feel ya
They respect the grind and zone 6 lookin' real soft

Dad's lying to me, I can hear it in his tone
I don't want nobody help, leave me the fuck alone
Brother holding my head in the shower don't know what I'm on
Rivers running through my nappy afro
Feeling guilty, won the raffle

INT. MANSION - NIGHT
The Boy sits at his piano; playing randomly, trying to make sense of everything/anything. Steve and Swank talk to Emily and MISLA in the kitchen. They're arguing about driving, or cooking with coconut oil instead of olive oil, or something else they themselves will not care about or remember in a month, year, ten years, 100 years, the age of the universe
The house is starting to look pretty bad. The cleaners that used to come stopped receiving their payment and stopped coming. Plastic cups are starting to spread like a blue rash across the living room and coffee tables. Every surface has a sticky spot. You used to be able to slide into the kitchen from the living room with a two second run and quick stop. Now, dried alcohol stops you before you even get to the kitchen door. The Boy really loved sliding into the kitchen when he was a kid. It was the closest you could get to having powers
**************
Minutes go by. People start to crowd around The Boy as he continues on piano. So many people he can't think
Fam daps up a kid as he walks in. They then walk over to a closet where Fam opens up a pantry of weed. It's not nostalgic rap video stocked with weed, but there's a lot of weed in there. Fam tosses an ounce of weed at the kid. The kid and his friend smell it and nod. They look to Fam to share a smile of like "good shit, right?", but Fam isn't there for em. Fam gives em the "where's my money you privileged ass-hole" look. They pull out some hundreds
Misla is sitting knees to chest with a french dude in the center of the pool table. They're eating s'mores
Emily and Steve are jumping over the fire pit like idiots
There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose tonight. It's a great time
But then:
...this is a waste
       THE BOY: Get
...of time
       THE BOY : Out. Everyone
No one can hear him. It's a party
       THE BOY : Everyone needs to get out. NOW!
People start to notice. The Boy gets up from the piano and grabs a pool stick. He quickly walks over to the ipod dock playing music and winds up like it's a bat
SMASH
Everyone stares
       FUCKBOY 2: That's my phone, nigga!
The Boy looks up. There's a deep inhale, then he starts smashing everything. Glass sprays everywhere, alcohol splashes, people start running out
       SOME DUDE 2: Worldstar!
The Boy continues hitting things. He's about to come down on somoeone's phone that's lying on the coffee table. He holds the pool cue above his head and lets it down fast
But right before, someone grabs the cell phone, laying their hand on top of it, daring The Boy to hit the hand. The Boy barely stops in time
The hand has a cast on it. The Boy looks up to see a girl  staring at him. She looks mad. The Boy is mad. But not at her. He's trying to look mad at her, but he really looks like "sorry"
Eyes locked
She slowly takes her phone, making complete eye contact the entire time, then walks out. Everyone stares at this strange interaction
As soon as she leaves, The Boy goes back to smashing things
       THE BOY: Get out! Get away!
Some people start running out trying not to get hit. Other people just laugh cause they're high or because they think it's pathetic. They all leave eventually
The Boy stands there for a moment. He turns to the bar next to the pool table. There's half a blunt and a bottle of Sriracha sitting there. The Boy takes the bottle and starts squirting it on the pool table
When he's done, he's written: "ROSCOE'S WETSUIT"
       FAM: Nice
The Boy turns. Fam's just sitting there. No one even noticed him. Fam gives him a SMH. The Boy leaves
CUT TO:
**************
INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - LATER NIGHT
The Boy lays in his bed. Blue and black stripes from the shades fold over his face. He can hear raccoons scurrying outside
He sees a spider in the corner of the room. Just sitting in its web
94
The Boy doesn't particularly like or dislike spiders. They're everywhere in the house. It's a big house and it's right next to a reserve. But something about this spider sitting there...it really bothers him. It makes him mad. He can hear the spider. Just sitting there. Getting louder
I'm going to describe it as emotional tinnitus: when everything is silent and quiet, you can see the empty web you're in. It is annoying. Which is the slowest form of torture
...The Boy gets up
CUT TO:INT. CAR - NIGHT
The Boy drives. I'm not sure where he's driving. He's not sure where he's driving
He drives about an hour out into some industrial wasteland-looking nook of Los Angeles
He parks his car
Then, barefoot, he sits on the roof of his car and watches the cars pass. Bright lights grow to an explosion then fade out as they pass. He goes into his pocket and holds the "hackz" flash drive that we saw on his desk at the beginning
Someone spray painted "ROSCOE'S WETSUIT" on the side of the bridge. The Boy is not surprised. It's not making more sense, but it's becoming more dependable, which is always nice
The Boy realizes he hasn't eaten all day. Maybe that's what's wrong
CUT TO:
EXT. FATBURGER - NIGHT
The Boy orders a burger in the drive thru
A skinny Latino kid with a Bluetooth hands him the bag. The Boy pulls over to the side and opens the bag. He looks at the burger for a moment
The Boy throws the burger out
CUT TO:
INT. MANSION - NIGHT
The Boy walks through the house; locking all the doors and turning off all the lights. It's always a weird feeling to walk around the house at night because most of the walls are glass, so people can see right inside, especially when it's dark. It's pretty hard to even get to the house, it's the highest home on the hill and there's a long winding road before . But at the same time, if someone got up there, it'd be easy to figure out how to get in
All the lights are off now
The Boy walks over to The Buddha in the middle of the foyer. He sits on the floor next to him with his knees to his chest. Looking out the front door into half the darkness and half his reflection. He used to be terrified of this Buddha. When he was little, he'd run behind the statue like it would jump on him as soon as he past. But He slowly became something like a best friend. Something like that
INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT
The Boy pours Pelligrino into a wine glass. Then he continues to twist his metal weed grinder in his hand. He takes the top off the grinder and pours the white powder inside the glass. He drinks it, then sits on the foot of the bed and takes off his white T-shirt
Pulling the covers over his body, he looks at the spider in the corner...only it was gone. Where'd it go? Why would it leave? What about its parents? Won't they be sad? What a bout hi s frien ds? W hat ab o u   t all his s t uf f h o w  wa s h  esu p p ose d to ke e  p     all h is s ... .    . . . .....
RAP GENIUS NOTE: This is the end of Part 3, continue on at Part 4Childish Gambino, yeah, my voice is annoying
So I don't talk, I let the streets talk for me
Yeah, these girls crazy, half got children
I hate their ex-boyfriends, call 'em Scott Pilgrim
I'm fucking girls I really shouldn't be fucking with
But if we get caught, we just hand it off to our publicists
Plus, I hang with some of their ex boyfriends
What can I say? I make bad choices
Culdesac dropped, day one, five figures
Fish fry, nigga, fry mine bigger
Still unsigned, fans saying "What's the hold out
When every show you've ever done's been sold out?"
I always wondered what this Hollywood would do to me
"Who's that rapping—Yo, it's Troy from Community!"
"Fuck that man, dude, you lying like a muh'fuck!
Besides, the beat's real good, but the lyrics suck."
Well I made the beat too, yeah, soak it in
I'm a phenom, nigga, where the fuck you been?
People say that I should be more humble
And I hope they understand that they don't listen when you mumble
And it only takes a lie to make a dynasty crumble
That why I catch feelings and these other dudes fumble
I'm not playing, this music's something that I care about
I take your shit to the streets, watch me air it out
Get the check, deposit the shit at Maxfield
Feeling myself, I don't even need an ex-pill
"I wish he'd do a funny rap, like SNL did."
If I don't take myself serious, who the fuck else will?
And to the critics with reviews that were more than sour
Is it strange having jobs I can do tomorrow?
You bitches don't like shit, and it's kinda sad
I like food, sex, clothes, watching Breaking Bad
I’m something that these cool kids never really had
That's why these nerdy kids come find me on the internet
I wanna be different, I wanna do it good
Not another actor-turn-rapper in movies 'bout the hood
Niggas say they want the real, but get mad when they hear the truth
Please forgive them, father, for they're not knowing what they do
I make this music so these younger dudes don't have to choose
Trying to hate me means you really hate you
Life goes fast and I'm holding on tight
I let things go when I'm holding this mic
And it's six in the morn', I've been writing all night
If I keep on going, I'm hoping I might be
Untouchable, untouchable, untouchable
My dad called saying, "Son, are you okay?
I just listened to ‘The Last’ on your mixtape."
Dad, I'm fine, you just need to understand
When I'm rapping on a track, that's exactly who I am
And all my smart friends saying, "I really liked your album, dude
But you could be the next Mos Def if you wanted to."
Dear friends, I respect your responses
But my life is a dream, so I rap unconscious
I'm sorry guys, I hope I didn't let you down
I rap what I know, I hope the fans will work it out
Not conceited, but sick of trying to lay low
No drugs, I'm just tryna tell 'Ye "yo.”
Online dudes shouting out that they better than me
I'm doing three other jobs, bitch, you better be
Cause if you're trying really hard, that's embarrassing
I won't stop until I'm fucking running everything
The more I rap, the more I'm harder to follow
I get a text from Questlove, I gotta call ‘em tomorrow
Coming harder than other dudes, it's harder to swallow
That I'm blowing up; 13 Mission: Apollo
Fuck niggas who doubted me, eat your words, it's a feast
I used to hear "Nah's" all the time like Kelis
Fuck the old Donald Glover, yeah, I'm glad he's deceased
Cause that sad weak being's been replaced with a beast
Life goes fast and I'm holding on tight
I let things go when I'm holding this mic
And it's six in the morn', I've been writing all night
If I keep on going, I'm hoping I might be
Untouchable, untouchable, untouchableWhy go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all?
Two shots and a body, two shots and a body
Two shots and a body involved
Where are those subtle men?
With the decency to might be wrong
Where are those winter girls?
Who corrected, say women
I'm sorry, forgiven
Why would we ever change?
Planets never see a day that isn't towards the Sun
Bliss is a cheap emotion, everyone here seems to afford
So I don't know why I'm here without you, you
Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all?
When you're not invited, you take what you're given
Some wait every day for the call
Grief is a standing ocean, I never swam unless you did
So I don't know why I'm here without you
I miss you
Why go to the party? Why go to the party?
Why go to the party at all? 
I call to a spirit, you may never hear it
How else could I keep you alive? Alive
'Cause it's hard for me to love myself without you here
'Cause the days are slow, but the years are fast
I wonder when I'll feel your smileWe finally made it
And now we sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps askin'
How'd it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How'd it get so wonderful? 
So wonderful 
You can call the shots, I’m going to my aunt’s house
What’s it all about? Lookin’ like I’m Millhouse
What’s it all about? I ain’t get my bike back
I ain’t get my bike back, I know where he live at
I know what he look like, I know what I live like
Five to a bed, head to toe, that’s a good night
Five to a bed, head to toe, with the fan on
I don’t think these other niggas know what ya man on
I used to have to sneak just to get my food
Free lunch made it feel like they don’t approve
Sell a card for a dollar used to be the move
I wanna be Jabari man, that nigga cool
I wanna lash out, nigga keep your cool
All my friend did was draw something, now he outta school
‘Cause everything was always “Show me what you made of”
And everybody knew somebody who was laid up
I didn’t need it, mama said it’s a lesson
Some people will never like you
Don’t let ’em catch you stressin’
You know a code’s a code, the world can’t stop ’em
Eating out rat holes and Cheerios boxes
This nigga think he hot shit, he think he good at everything
I just didn’t wanna get left out more
My little sis’ mom got shot, she in the newspaper
Prayers couldn’t save her, she died a day later
Like my cousin got that HIV
When she bust the leg open playing jump rope
Should I tell them kids what the fuck’s up?
They gon' judge her and me
Man fuck them, we livin’, all is forgiven
I fucked up royally
But now that’s who we are man, you gotta use the royal "we"
This is royalty, and this is all I ever wanted ‘cause

Yeah, it's Childish Gambino, yeah I'm fly as a feather
Yeah, my nigga be suburban but my flow keep it ghetto
Keep my swagger Polaroid, you can watch it develop
Ain't it funny? In a year, I went from different to special
Yeah I got it together, yeah, I took those chances
Labels on me like I might cause cancer
Yes a nigga flow went from Camry to Phantom
I'm just talking real shit, hoping you can handle
Sleeping on the jet like "lier" like chandle
Flyer than a jet women, hoping they can land him
How we turn everything to gold that they hand 'em?
I am just different, that's the only answer
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop

I'm a hero, I'm a hero, yeah
Back on my grind, nigga I'm a skater
She just think I'm fine, nigga you's a hater
Style with no name, they just want to label me
They should call it what these other niggas are afraid to be
APC store walkin' out with eight bags
Yeah I'm killin' paper, call it poppin' tag
You ever spend three grand on designer vision
When you should really spent it on your little sis tuition?
She played my album when nobody else out there would listen
I'm comin' harder than these girls that you would swear were pissin'
Davinci-esque, I'm the real deal
The only thing I don't know is how fake feel
I'm living everything these other niggas lyin' bout
Bitches don't believe me, to prove it to em I fly 'em out
She say that I'm her everything, I'm better than those other guys
I say, "I'm just a rapper" She tell me, "That's a fuckin' lie"

But that would make me MJ, so motherfuck all of y'all
Trippin' on this fame shit, drinking like a fuckin fish
Listen to the next track, "I be on that other shit"
Yes I sound weird, nigga, take it as a compliment
Guess who's in the house and representing like a congressman
Anything I put my mind to I accomplish it
From writing scripts with Tina Fey to laying down the hardest shit
Who else is doing what I'm doing? No one
And I mean girls too, intended no pun
I'm on the road son, busy like I'm Bone Thug
Comment left anonymous cause ain't nobody want none
She laying in my bed she gotta be bi-curious
Barf on the track, be amazing and rap-furious
Damn bloggers argue whether or not I'm serious
It's Nas' Illmatic, not Eddie Murphy's Delirious
Got the limelight, you stupid you think I'm sharing this
Showin' up late, promoters wondering where he is
Got some nightmares, but failing's gotta be scariest
But I would never fail, I'm a hero, one of the best there is
Yeah, yes I'm on top
I'm going this hard, and no I won't stop
Yeah, yes I'm on top

I really appreciate it 
Hey go DJ! 
Hey go DJ! 
Hey go DJ! 
Stuntin' 101, I'm doing shit that ya'll never done
Talking from TVs and movies, these the choppers to Uzis
Nothing can bruise me, nigga this is more than a movement
My squad is forever, we ain't getting annulments
New song on your speakers got me getting enormous
Played a performance, niggas getting paid on performance
A lot of ya'll hate cause my women is gorgeous
I mean they a work of art, something out of a portrait
I mean I'm a work of art, all my verses is poetry
Niggas is different, you chicken, we ain't fucking with poultry
Bunch of crab ass bloggers got me allergic to shellfish
If I fell off in a day, man, these niggas be helpless
I be bringing on a plane 'till you lames get mailed it
It's ROYALTY and, nigga, I'm the king like Elvis
I don't talk about it, let them niggas conversate
What's the song about it? Give her D and smoke a J
We don't play, I'm so on a bench, money is the stench
Let me vent, I'mma smoke 'em out, circles from her mouth
What's my favorite sound? "Oh my God I'm cumming"
Second favorite sound? "Oh that sound like money"
Oh that sound like freedom
Oh that sound gon' need a feature but he didn't need him
I'm coming back like Jesus, color Reeces Pieces
That's the money down here, we gon' need a Visa
Bread like he Anita
That's my DJ, thank you DJ Drama
Came in this bitch like my baby mama
I believe in karma so I run the summer
All I got is checks, check out all these commas!
Check out how I'm eating, it is very cool
James White a nigga, man I'm such a fool
I'm doing me so cold, this nigga spitting so cold
His girl 20 years old, she know she 'bout to get choose
That rabbit hole, I'm talking shit, but I'm rapping though
And that IRS and I'm taxing hoes and I saw the check
And said "add some o's, add some o's!"
Why my clique so animal? Why my clique so Set It Off?
And I'm Queen Latifah you know I'm eatin', I fucked it up
Niggas think we ain't tough enough, niggas think we was born rich
Niggas thinking a lot of shit, niggas don't know a wars coming
Niggas don't know I saw something, killing trees, Paul Bunyon
Bunyon foot, foot clan, klans man... Alamo
Stream of conscious, I don't know
Flow was done a long time ago, and I feel for niggas who save a ho
I ain't got time and I'm throwing up like gang signs
But that was not the case
You niggas wish your lifestyle was nice as my place
I'm eating off these white kids, I don't need their plate
We burning down that blue dream, she sitting on my face
I'd leave it on her backside, but that'd be a waste
That be a waste, that be a waste

3. Which track is your favorite?
@ChildishGambino
I guess “oldest computer” mackelmore was supposed to be on it, but it became a little too house-y. then ms.banks came and made it a different song. it was cool to see
I never feel like everything’s done honestly

@Skyart
1) What are you saying @2:23 on Zealots…

@ChildishGambino
I’m saying “wanna walk too?”
Rich people wear whatever they want
@CLOUDS
During what season did you record this album?
Spring? summer? fall? winter?
Did it have an effect on your songwriting/state of mind/et cetera?
Thnx
@ChildishGambino
I started Christmas day of last year. we were recording on this mountain above weather, so we weren’t cold unless we came down. I made it with winter in mind
@streetlights
- Will you be my friend and can we eat Osso buco together?

@AKNC17
Sorry to get personal right away but people always ask basic ass questions in Q and A’s so here it goes
I know you were raised Jehovah’s Witness but do you still follow any type of religion?
@ChildishGambino
I don’t really believe in religion for myself. i’ve become spiritual, more at peace with things. but i don’t believe in god. not like that
@goochcrucible

What was the meaning behind the title of “Clapping for the Wrong Reasons”?
@ChildishGambino
Its a semi famous quote
@Robertf
Donald, can you explain the greatness of Sade’s debut album “Diamond Life.” I would appreciate a very detailed explanation of why Sade is so great and what she means to you as an artist. If you refuse to answer this question I will take it to mean you do not enjoy the musical styling of Sade….and as such you will draw my full ire
-22 y.o male who has just gotten heavily into Sade’s music
@ChildishGambino
I was literally listening to sade yesterday. she’s a world artist. and her music is just in tune with whatever vibration we all run on. I can’t answer a lot of your questions about her, all i can say is she’s a special artist/being
@MaxGertler
What does the ending of the last song symbolize? like that life can end at any second randomly?
@ChildishGambino
You should read the ‘because the internet’ script when it’s released
@CrookedModerator
If you could trade hairlines with another person, who would it be?
@ChildishGambino
They tell me i should fix my hairline cause i got money now
I ain’t gon sit around and front like i ain't thought about it
A perfect hairline is more appealing but it’s funny how
My shit is FUCKED UPPPPPPP but look how far i done got without it
I keep my HALF OF AN OCTAGON hairline fucked up just to show the kids it’s real
@Kid_Kamikazee
What did your followers realize at the end of The Biggest Troll?
@ChildishGambino
They realize “they don’t need a leader”
@Fran-Soul
Dude you are awesome love your music and my question is do you ever see your self touring Africa? coz that’s the only way I will ever see you unless you buy me a plane ticket to see you live in the US
Pliz respond
@ChildishGambino
I really wanna see africa. we were planning on south africa soon
@WiggityWackWes
1. There were huge jumps style-wise and sonically from Camp to Royalty to Because the Internet, do you see yourself developing a “signature sound” or do you plan on keeping things experimental and constantly trying new sounds?
2. Your music has helped me through a lot and continues to, so I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for what you do. Thank you!
@ChildishGambino
Thanks
I always wanna experiment. in everything. i’ll always try to push myself. i just never wanna be bored
@RayBeach
Do you make things that have or message or do you just let people interpret it? Kind of like 3005?
@ChildishGambino
I make things with messages for me in them. i hope they translate. sometimes they don’t, and that’s fine, but i usually just try to touch on something that’s intangible for me
@BasedGator
Question part: What inspires you when it comes to production? I hear a lot of tradtional trap drums and sounds on the new album, which make sense since your from the south, but you didn’t really do that on Camp. Then you got something like ‘Zealots of Stockholm’ where it gets Death Grip-ish. Is it as simple as your just finding the right sound for the lyrics or do you draw from other things?
Since your probably not going to see/respond to this, let me stan a little bit haha
Stan part: You are my role model, I can identify with your life and lyrics so well it’s crazy. I really hope in 10 years I can be as successful and well respected as you. I already liked your comedy and acting, but ever since I found out you rapped and I heard that E.E. Cummings line in ‘Freaks and Geeks’ I was hooked. Anyway, The new album is dope as heck, great work as always sir, and I can’t wait to see what you do in the future
@ChildishGambino
Ha. thanks
I try not to think to hard about what’s trap drums, what’s influenced by who’s hot now, and all that. i try to just find what feels honest. cause i don’t know if i’d wanna hear a song that was considered entire original by everyone, but was no fun to make. this album, tho it came from a messy place, was by far the most fun to make
@SavvyRJA
It sounds like you are influecnced by john lennon quite alot? care to elaborate?
@ChildishGambino
To be honest, i don’t know much about him. i was always a beach boys dude over beatles. i learned a little about him through jhene
@SavvyRJA
Who is your favorite artist outside of Hip-Hop?
Perosnally, Gorillaz or Red Hot Chilli Peppers
@ChildishGambino
Anything by sam cooke
@griffinmahon
Do you think there is more room for expression or creativity in short films as opposed to full-length movies? Does this translate to the relationship between mixtapes and albums in rap?
@ChildishGambino
Short films just fit normal people a little better. time is ultimate currency. we don’t have a lot of time to spend. a short film, for me, leaves more to the audience, and doesn’t take so much time. And if it’s free, then you really have no excuse not to watch it and at least have an opinion
@Flowmatic
Whats your perspective on camp looking back at it now ?
@ChildishGambino
I love camp. it there’s little things i’d change, cause i know how music better, but yeah. i does what it’s supposed to do
@FlyTendencies
How do you sing so beautifully?
@ChildishGambino
That’s what you call it?
@A1_Day
Did My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus’s sound play a role in Because The Internet? How big of a influence is Kanye to you?
@ChildishGambino
I guess it influenced me as much as it influenced all music to be better? but honestly, his whole steez isn’t for me. I can’t do that. he just inspires me to be limitless
@StefanPonce
CAN YOU BREAK DOWN THE SONG TO “BOY BAND” ?!!!???!!!!

How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren’t real?
@ChildishGambino
Mirrors aren’t real

What’s the biggest opportunity that you could have taken but you missed out on in your life? Did you explain the abrupt ending on Life: The Biggest Troll?
@ChildishGambino
I don’t feel like I’ve missed any opportunity, honestly

Hey Donald, big fan here . I have a couple of questions
1) Do you have a whole bunch of those white shirts or is it the same one?
2) Are you thinking about doing another comedy special in the near future?
3) What was your sister’s reaction to your fame and come up in the rap game?
4) Has Chevy Chase ever recited any of your lyrics or played any of your songs?
Thanks for just taking the time to read the questions. roscoes wetsuit
@ChildishGambino

2) i honestly don’t know
3) she’s good with it. she’s the best
4) no. I’m positive he has never heard of childish gambino. I’m pretty sure he thought i was eddie murphy the entire we were on set
@AkonoMiles
My question to you childish is what advice do you have for all the creatives out there that work so much on polishing their craft. that surround themselves with all types of shit, music, art, etc and try as much to absorb to than emit that knowledge into their work. what advice do you have childish cause sometimes i be feeling like im going nowhere. especially seeing others who do what i do get further than me when their ideas are really nothing but regurgetated shit we’ve all seen. i just feel like im going crazy sometimes yo. haha. thanks — akono
@ChildishGambino
Yeah. i think you have just look at what y o u really want. it can be frustrating. but u also have to know how people work and what people want from you
You should read “mastery” by robert greene
@ChildishGambino
Cool. i have some work to do
Thanks for the questions. rap genius is a dope place. cool to see you guys taking such good care of it
Happy leak day
Everyone kiss notero goodnight

Having nightmares that I'm the black Heath Ledger
Sleep when I'm dead, these voices in my head

I tell them that "It better be, I did this shit on purpose!"
The worst is being worthless, now a nigga priceless
Bloomingdale's coat, I don't have to check the prices
But I only go to feel a sense of control
'Cause I get this shit for free if I wear promotional
And I'm not emotional when I do my work
I get emotional when I order that dessert
'Cause she always ate dessert
And I deserted her
But I refuse to compromise career for a girl
'Cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul
And if I let it go, there'd be no one left to know
Being happy is the goal, but greatness is my vision
And all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition
But, baby, I am different
This shit is my life
And if you don't believe me, you can never be wife
I'm walking in this darkness and I'm tryna find a light
And I'd rather die than be average and chances are I might, because
Things are changing, my life's gone pecans
Thirteen cities in the last eight weekends

**************
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
The Boy wakes up. He's in a gown. His eyes feel heavy. The TV is on in his room. "Golden Girls" to be specific. One of the ladies just said something funny cause there's a lot of laughter
Sitcom laughs always freaked him out. Because most of those people are dead. Those are ghost laughs. Laughs that are supposed to be gone forever linger on earth after every mid 90s joke about teenage sex or someone saying "don't go there". Looking for their mouths, never finding them because they're gone. The laughs don't feel good because they're dead laughs. Those laughs aren't what they stood for anymore. They've been reappropriated. Now they're just sounds monkey descendants make when amused to cue other monkey descendants when to make the sounds at home
...my eyes feel heavy
A nurse comes in
       WHITE GUY NURSE: Hello Mr.. How are you feeling?
       THE BOY: Like I'm about to get talked to by someone about-  All this
Nurse gives a "yep" look
       WHITE GUY NURSE: You're friends brought you in-
       THE BOY: They're not my friends
       WHITE GUY NURSE: I don't think they'd like you saying that
       THE BOY: Doesn't matter. It's the truth. But also, they know. We're not friends. There's a mutual benefit to our relationship, but I can't trust them for shit
       WHITE GUY NURSE: Then why save you?
       THE BOY: Cause their lives are far easier with me around. It's survival
       WHITE GUY NURSE: I think you should talk to someone
       THE BOY: We're talking
       WHITE GUY NURSE: A professional
       THE BOY: Why? You don't care. You're not gonna make sure I do.  Our lives aren't precious, man
Silence. The Nurse begins to clean up
       WHITE GUY NURSE: You done?
       THE BOY: I was trying to be
       WHITE GUY NURSE: No you weren't. Cause, guess what? It's not hard to do
Nurse leaves
INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY
The Boy walks out of the double doors. Steve, Swank, and Fam are sitting there. They look up wearily
       THE BOY: I don't wanna talk. Let's just go be awkward and quiet together at Chipotle. Alright?
They all just stare. Swank gets up slowly and walks over
       SWANK: Man...we didn't know if we should wait or tell you later, man
The Boy makes a  face
       SWANK : Man...your pops died, man. Got the call
Silence
       THE BOY: Okay
**************
INT. JET PLANE - EVENING
The Boy lays his head against the plane window, the oil from his hair leaving grease smudges all over the window
His father died in Stockholm. A family member was needed. Didn't realize that they were each other's only family til this very moment. When you lose that, you basically lose most of your memories, at least the accuracy of your own memories
He wanted to be cremated
The Boy didn't really know anyone in Stockholm, but he also didn't want to be in his hotel room with his father for a day. Even if he was just ashes. So he decided to search through his followers for someone from Sweden
Some girl named "Hello_Pity_" Dm'd him back and they were supposed to meet up after all the whatever he had to do. Her profile bio said she was half french. She looked pretty in her avi: an inverted Hello Kitty. But that really doesn't mean anything at all, especially since her instagram was blocked, which is something he's learned not to trust at all
So he looked through her tweets, figured out a night she went to a club, used one of his dummy profiles and pretended that they'd met at the club that night. She had trouble remembering because, according to her feed, she was "fuckin turnt,  lol". She added this made up dude as a friend on Facebook. Now The Boy could see her pictures
The rest of her pictures confirmed she was indeed pretty
This girl loves Justin Bieber though. New Justin Bieber. The "fuck you" Bieber. She loves Justin Bieber in the way you love that girl on Maury who's like "my favorite flavor popsicle is DICK!", which is close to sincere love, but nowhere near it at the same time
INT. STRANGE OFFICE - NIGHT
The Boy is sitting at a desk, across from a solemn man. An urn sits on the left side of the desk
The man slides it over to The Boy
       SOLEMN MAN: I'm sorry for your loss
Silence. Don't you have to ask someone before you cremate their father? I don't know how these things work
       SOLEMN MAN : These were found with him
He gives The Boy a large brown paper bag
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
The Boy vapes on the foot of his bed. He's DMing back and forth with "Hello_Pity_" whose real name is Alyssa
       thegoldmolar: where u at
       Hello_Pity_: bar called box. meet u here?
       thegoldmolar: yeah
       Hello_Pity_: u should meet my boyfriend. he loves you
Weird
       thegoldmolar: sure
       Hello_Pity_:  LOL. Don't worry. It's not like that
       thegoldmolar: wdym
       Hello_Pity_:  see u soon
He puts his phone down
EXT. STOCKHOLM STREETS - NIGHT
There's a buzz going on. Very pretty people walk hand in hand on the street. There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose tonight. It's a great time
A couple walk by:
       SUPER HANDSOME GUY: Swedish blah blah blah roscoe's wetsuit hahahaha!
       SUPER PRETTY GIRL: blah blah, swedish blah blah roscoe's wetsuit!
The Boy walks up to a pink, glowing, but very discreet sign that says "box". There's a big bald guy standing outside with no hat. There's steam coming off his head
A girl is standing outside smoking, at least trying to. She can't seem to get the cigarette lit. It's Alyssa
       THE BOY: Hey
       ALYSSA: Ah! It's you
She gives him a kiss on both cheeks
       ALYSSA : Fancy meeting you like this, huh?
       THE BOY: I don't know what you mean
She puts out her cigarette. After two big puffs
       ALYSSA: Let's go
       THE BOY: Didn't you want me to meet your boyfriend?
       ALYSSA: Who? That guy?
She points to a corner of the building, a few steps from the front. A guy with long blonde hair is making out with a girl in the cold
       THE BOY: What am I getting into?
       ALYSSA: Nothing. You're getting into nothing
CUT TO:
EXT. STOCKHOLM STREETS - CONTINUOUS
The Boy and Alyssa walk slowly through the streets. It's very cold, so they're the only ones doing that
       ALYSSA: What made you DM me?
       THE BOY: I don't know anyone here
       ALYSSA: Then why are you here?
       THE BOY: My dad died. I have to pick him up
       ALYSSA: R O U G H. How?
       THE BOY: Doesn't matter at this point
       ALYSSA: I know right? It's always "how'd he die?" Like if you know all the ways, you'll avoid it. Silly
She shivers
       ALYSSA : I don't believe in small talk. What's the longest relationship you've been in?
       THE BOY: Five years
       ALYSSA: Wow. What happened?
       THE BOY: I'm still in it
       ALYSSA: Oh?
       THE BOY: She does private web shows. We're not together. But it's a relationship, for sure
       ALYSSA: I don't get it
       THE BOY: I used to watch her online a while back. Then she quit and started doing private shows. Then it just started turning into talking. Mostly
       ALYSSA: Wooooaah
       THE BOY: Wha?
       ALYSSA: You're paying her to be your girlfriend or friend or whatever
       THE BOY: Yes. But most people are paying for friends one way or another
       ALYSSA: No
       THE BOY: Your boyfriend is making out with another girl right now. You don't really have room to judge
       ALYSSA: I trust that I can never trust him. We're clear on that
       THE BOY: Then why have him at all?
       ALYSSA: Because he's honest. And I like that. He doesn't lie to either of us. That's special to me
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
The two are sitting on the bed staring at the urn on the table
       ALYSSA: So that's your dad
       THE BOY: That's my dad. That's what's left of him
       ALYSSA: You guys close?
       THE BOY: No
       ALYSSA: You wanna talk about it
       THE BOY: No
Silence
       THE BOY : I'm going to make a drink
       ALYSSA: Alright
The Boy gets up and goes into the living room. While he's in there, Alyssa gets up, takes the urn, and walks out of the room. The Boy hears the door slam
       THE BOY: Alyssa?
CUT TO:
**************
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
The Boy runs out of the front doors. His breath, clouding in the night. He looks both ways and catches Alyssa turning a corner. He runs to the corner and meets her on the other side
       THE BOY: What's going on
       ALYSSA: Let's get rid of it. It's just bad for you
       THE BOY: You have a TON of nerve judging me and my father's relationship, so much so, you just walk out with his ashes? I feel like what you're doing is against the law, but much like the fact he was cremated before I arrived, I don't know if it's illegal. I'm still pissed though
       ALYSSA: We're gonna do this together
The Boy is pissed. He's trying not to blow up
       ALYSSA : I had a sister. I did this when she died
       THE BOY: Yes. That gives you the right
Alyssa digs in her pocket and pulls out her phone. She turns it on and the background is Alyssa and a girl that looks exactly like her. The Boy takes the phone
       THE BOY : Twins
       ALYSSA: Yes
       THE BOY: I know we agreed that it's dumb to ask since we're all headed that way anyway, but-
       ALYSSA: Brain cancer. It was bad
Silence
       ALYSSA : So crazy
She LOLs. They're still walking this entire time. They stop at the water. They stand there making small clouds for a moment
       ALYSSA : You want to say something?
The Boy shrugs
       ALYSSA : Alright-
       THE BOY: Wait
The urn almost tips over the edge. She waits for him. He walks over and takes the urn and just holds it for a moment. Then he kinda hugs it. Laying his head on it, but turning his head so she can't see what he says:
       THE BOY : I'm sorry we're alone
He pours out the ashes. He's gone
       ALYSSA: How do you feel? Better?
       THE BOY: I feel...the same
       VOICE: HEY!
Alyssa and The Boy turn around. It's Alyssa's boyfriend
       BOYFRIEND: What the fuck, bro?
       ALYSSA: Oh, so you now you give a fuck
She pushes him back as he takes swipes at The Boy. The Boy is mildly annoyed. They're all yelling at each other
       BOYFRIEND/THE BOY/ALYSSA: You're dead ass-hole!/ Relax, nothing happened/ Would you stop!
The boyfriend breaks free from her
       BOYFRIEND: Do you know who the fuck I am?
       ALYSSA: Please don't. Please don't do this
       THE BOY: Nah, man. I don't know who you are
       BOYFRIEND : WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY!  I. Wrote. That. That's my shit. I'm the nigga dressed like a fox. That's all me
       THE BOY: What?
The boyfriend starts making the noises a fox makes in the song
       BOYFRIEND: That!
       ALYSSA : Like the song and video
       THE BOY: I've never heard of it
       ALYSSA AND BOYFIREND: What/wha?
       ALYSSA: I thought you "were the internet"?
       THE BOY: That's a tagline. No one is the actual internet. I just must've missed it when it was popular
       BOYFRIEND: Uh, by "when it was popular" do you mean, uhhh, RIGHT THE FUCK NOW?!
       THE BOY: Relax
       BOYFRIEND: Two hundred and twenty million views on Youtube. Two hundred and twenty million. That's most of the earth
       THE BOY: Not true
       BOYFRIEND: An African village wrote to me-
       THE BOY: The whole village did?
       BOYFRIEND: -and told me that my song taught them about foxes. They don't have foxes there. I introduced the idea of a fox to an entire continent... And you wanna fuck my girl?
Silence
       THE BOY: I do not wanna fuck your girl. I don't want to be here. I am going home now
The Boy walks away. Alyssa and her boyfriend start a boring argument in the cold as he disappears
CUT TO:
INT. LA VEGAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Fam, another girl, and The Boy sit in a booth at the restaurant. Fam and the girl are talking. The Boy is silent. Don't know if he's just bored or jet lagged from Sweden. Either way he's bumming everyone out
       ANOTHER GIRL: My friend should be here soon
The Boy doesn't say anything. Fam and the girl look on
A girl walks up to the table. The Boy looks up. It's the girl from the party
       NAOMI: Hi
The Boy doesn't say anything
       ANOTHER GIRL: This is Naomi.  Hello?
       FAM: He's dumb. You should just sit and ignore him
She sits down
       NAOMI: You're the guy that almost hit my arm
       THE BOY: Yes
       NAOMI: You guys order?
       THE BOY: No. I hate vegan. I think she's making us eat here
       NAOMI: I'm the vegan. I asked to eat here
Silence
       THE BOY: I hate vegan
       NAOMI : Duhh, "I hate vegan"
In his head, he was lol-ing. In real life, he just kinda looked down
       NAOMI : What's the deal. Why you always act like your parents died
The Boy smirks
       THE BOY: They did
Awkward. Silence
       ANOTHER GIRL: I'm so sorry
Fam and The Boy stare at each other for a moment. Then laugh. Another Girl and Naomi do not
       FAM : Your parents are dead, man
       THE BOY: My parents are dead yo
They slowly stop laughing. Naomi thinks The Boy is weird. But she doesn't run
INT. MANSION - NIGHT
Fam and Another Girl are sitting on the swings smoking and talking about something they will never remember and don't really care about
Naomi and The Boy sit in the living room
       NAOMI: What did he do?
       THE BOY: I don't know
       NAOMI: How'd he afford all this?
       THE BOY: I don't know
       NAOMI: Then how can you afford all this? He leave you a lot?
       THE BOY: Creditors were after him. I don't know if he had anything left. I'm not concerned.  I'm gonna sell drugs
Naomi LMAOs
       NAOMI: Whaaaaaat
       THE BOY: Fam can hook me up. I've been watching him for a minute. He runs out of here already
       NAOMI: I don't think you need me to tell you you're an awful dealer
       THE BOY: How would you even know?
       NAOMI: You make everything feel awkward. You can't connect with anyone. How is anyone supposed to feel like they can trust you?
       THE BOY: Yeah, that's what drug dealers are known for. Their comfort
       NAOMI: They are, dumb-ass. You gotta know how people work. You're only good with people online
He slowly turns to her. "how does she know that?"
       NAOMI : I looked you up
       THE BOY: After the party or just now
       NAOMI: Just now. I'm a writer too
       THE BOY: Oh really
       NAOMI: Yup. And I know I'm good cause people keep stealing my shit
She hits the vape
       NAOMI : I tweeted this.  Is that not my poem verbatim? I posted them together. This nigga just rapped this like it was his
       THE BOY : Your first mistake is being a poet past the year 1974, by the way
       NAOMI: That's how good my shit is. I'm bringing the whole form back
       THE BOY: You're cocky when you're high
       NAOMI: No. I'm talkative when I'm high. I'm cocky all the time, but I'm silent for most of it...like you
He looks up. She lifts an eyebrow. He doesn't smile. She goes cross-eyed. No response. She stops, then sighs
       NAOMI : You ever think we're in hell? This is all hell. Living on earth and being the only ones aware that it's all ending slowly
Silence
       THE BOY: No
       NAOMI: I read something that said more than likely we all just do this all again. It's all a cycle
       THE BOY: I like that theory
       NAOMI: Yeah.  See? You're not such a lonely boy
She LOLs and mushes his face with her hand. The Boy smh, but smiles

I'm looking back on the days that we both had
I go to bed and I dream so hard
Of little mixed kids running in the front yard
I need you close, I need your kiss
I never ever, ever, ever knew a love like this
I, miss you more than Puffy missed B.I.G
I didn't think that you would leave a hole this big
In my life, you need to be my wife
I made this song while holdin' the pillow tight
And wishin' that it was you, what can a nigga do
Fuck this success, fuck these interviews
Fuck these phone calls, girl you are worth it
When I was happy, you were happy, you are perfect
When I was blue, you were blue, you're my Smurfette
I put my best chips on the worst bet
Girl, I need you like I need air
And fuck these other honeys, I will be there
I never ever, ever thought that I would be scared
Of living in a world when you are not there
My biggest fear is that you won't give a fuck
When you play this song on your MacBook
"Is that CG, yo, he's old news
I'm way too busy with my new dude."
The best time I ever had
Is kissing in my shitty ass Ikea bed
I wish that it was me instead
Feeling all your pain
I know that it is different now
It will never be the same but
I swear to God, our love special
You can be my number 2 like one pencil
Or you can be my number one, I will let you
In on my life, I've changed so much since you
Left, that hotel room
And if you're with another guy, go tell dude
That he could never keep us apart, he needs a better door
He'll always be the guy that you settle for
I'll always be the guy you're supposed to be with
Where the fuck is Cupid when you need him
I'm so Sam Cooke, I need Cupid too
I play Sam Cooke and I think of you
Baby girl we need to be together
This song ain't for my album
This song is for the better
And even though I'm living in a city full of strangers
They can see I'm different
They can see my anger
They can see my pain
They can see the way I talk about you
They see the way I'm living and I won't live long without you
I drink every night, I smoke more too
I think it is safe to say death or you
I need you more now than I ever did
I'm still the same guy you fell in love with
I need a second chance like I need a prayer
Sometimes I think God just doesn't care
I hope he has a plan for both you and I
So we can be together at a different time
Remember when I come home late
And you'd be crying over some food on a cold plate
I'll never do that shit to you again
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever known and my best friend
Baby girl we need to make up
And when I dream of you, I don't want to wake up
And when I don't dream, I don't want to wake up
I'd rather die now than not have your touch
Cause I miss you so muchRAP GENIUS NOTE: This is Part 5 of the script, read Parts 1-4 if you have not already
**************
This is the part where they kinda fall in love a little bit. But I feel like anything we put here wouldn't do justice to what really happens when a person you meet ends up in your life out of nowhere. But know that it's exactly how you expect it to be, but also more. It's a big inside joke that you can't mess up and only one other person in the world gets
It's not a very pretty or perfect love, or even necessarily a romantic love. It doesn't look cool.  It's more like two helpless things in the wild, and one says "I'll protect you", and both parties know it's a lie because there's no way either of them can protect the other from anything. That lie is the best way to describe this love. That feeling of not having to say "I'm scared", because you share the exact feelings without having words over or under complicate it, that's worth more than protection. It's a connection. The less alone. This is all we look for on earth
The Boy and Naomi hang a lot. They spend the night and make breakfast sometimes. He buys stuff for her. She makes him stuff. They watch cartoons together. They're always saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. They both have a purpose. It's a great time. Time passes
The Boy starts moving small amounts of weed out the mansion, but starts selling more to keep up, along with stuff that isn't weed. He started growing crop in the nursery. The electricity bill would be high, but he stopped living in the mansion. He started renting another place to stay and keep the business separate
To be honest it was getting a little out of hand, as Naomi predicted. The Boy is not a good dealer. A lot of people think you have to be cold and calculated, which he was to an extent. But you also have to know people. How they act/react. But it was still kinda fun up to this point
Then:
INT. RENTAL HOME - DAY
The Boy is washing dishes as Naomi stands next to him. They just had lunch
       NAOMI: Howbout'sm China, IL?
       THE BOY: Can't
       NAOMI: Can't why?
       THE BOY: I got a run to do
       NAOMI: Oh
Silence
       NAOMI : I thought you were having other guys do that now
       THE BOY: I am. Fam can't do this one
       NAOMI: If you're putting up the money you shouldn't be making the run
       THE BOY: I don't really trust anyone else to do it
       NAOMI: You don't really trust anyone
       THE BOY: I trust you
       NAOMI: You shouldn't
The Boy stops. She got em
       THE BOY: You're right
       NAOMI: I don't want to be right. I wanna help you
       THE BOY : "I don't wanna be right"
She doesn't laugh. He hopes she's LOLing inside. Cellphone vibrates on the counter across from them. The Boy goes over and reads the text
       THE BOY : I gotta go
       NAOMI: Alright
       THE BOY: You okay?
       NAOMI: I'm fine
       THE BOY: Is that a fake "I'm fine"
       NAOMI: No. It's what "I'm fine" always means
Nothing real is ever "fine". Remember this
       THE BOY: I'll be back
He walks out. They don't see each other anymore
EXT. I-10 - DAY
The Boy is driving down the highway listening to "Danny Glover" by Young Thug
EXT. MANSION - DAY
The car parks in the driveway. There are three cars already there. When he pulls up, he's playing "Made in America" by JAY Z and Kanye. When it goes off, he continues singing his version while walking up
       THE BOY: Sweet Cream Havarti/ Sweet Mozzarella/ Sweet Cheez-its. They're made in America/ Sweet Bowl of Cheez-its/ Ohhhhh-oohhhhh-
Four dudes are standing waiting at the front door
Something is wrong
The Boy stops singing and stands there in front of the dudes. They look at him
Alone
They all pull out 45s
********
INT. MANSION - DAY
They all walk in
       DUDE 1: Where the packs?
       THE BOY: In that closet
       DUDE 1: Sit over there
The Boy sits in the living room. Maybe he could run out the back? Where though?
They're at the top of a mountain. If someone heard a shot in this neighborhood, they'd call the police immediately. Unfortunately, there isn't a police department in the Palisades. He'd be waiting for the Santa Monica department, which would take a minute
The feeling The Boy had now was shockingly similar to the feeling he got at his own parties. People he didn't know or like casually walking through his home and him having to pretend everything is "fine", or that they don't have all the power
Maybe he could text Fam
       DUDE 1 : Give me your phone
The Boy hands him his phone. Fuck
Two dudes stand guard at the front and back exits. One dude packs the bricks from
The closet in a trash bag. Dude 1  is looking through The Boy's phone
It didn't feel like the day The Boy was going to die. Not to say The Boy didn't feel like he was going to die, he was certain he was going to die today. But he didn't feel like today felt like a/the last day/night. Like a Wednesday that keeps feeling like a Friday. But the more he thought about it, if the last day felt like the last day, the world would be a different place. The order we have everyday would vanish if you were guaranteed a warning. People wouldn't live like they do
They wouldn't care what you thought. It'd be anarchy. Or a utopia. Depending on who you ask
Dude 1 puts The Boy's phone in his pocket. The Boy doesn't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Dude 1 and Dude 2 start talking. It's obvious they're discussing The Boy's fate
If I was the director, the one who made this moment, the one who saw this moment millennia before, the one who coded this world and allowed this to happen, I'd have Thundercat's "We'll Die" playing as The Boy looks around at his once castle
...try to do your best
Oh! It's like Tony Montana. But resigned and, frankly, more realistic, cause it's boring. Everybody dies. Most of them are boring
All the dudes walk out except Dude 2. He stays. Dude 1 still has his phone as he walks out. The Boy realizes this action is bad
       DUDE 2: Toss me your wallet
This is bad. The Boy tosses the wallet. Dude 2 looks through it
       THE BOY: Can I drown?
Dude 2 looks up
       THE BOY : I just want to die how I want
There's a pool out there. You're supposed to get this wave of euphoria when you drown. Supposed to be good
Dude 2 stares
       THE BOY : I could just float there. They'd find me
Dude 2 starts to walks over...
Dude 2 sits next to him
       DUDE 2: We've been watching you for a while. You're very sloppy
He's a cop. This nigga's a cop
       DUDE 2 : I'm just gonna stay here with you for a minute. My guys are picking up those guys up the street
       THE BOY: Oh
Silence
       THE BOY : I'm going to jail?
       DUDE 2: Yep
The Boy looks to the pool in the backyard and sees his own body floating lifeless
Eyes wide, bubbles clinging to his face. Orange, yellow, and brown leaves float above him. His left shoe floating far ahead, probably from struggling at some point. Next to the pool, Naomi and Steve stand over him. Neither is crying or really seem too upset.  They just look on as if the movie they were watching took an abrupt turn and they're mildly interested rather than satisfied
It looks peaceful. Fitting. He'd like to go out like that
...what's that sound?
Tires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up. There's a small crash outside. Yelling
       VOICE: FREEZE!
GUNSHOTS
The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other
Dude 1 kicks open the door. He starts firing. Dude 2 falls. A mist of red puff spurts from his chest. He's screaming
Dude 1 turns to The Boy and sho
.......................
Silence
**********
THE ENDWe are really close and this party's really loud
We should go outside and talk, better yet, let's take a cab
We're kissing in the back, my apartment's pretty close
Baby, let me make you breakfast, an omelet with some toast
These girls are on my mind 
Wasn't my design
To be sitting here across from you, pretending I ain't lyin'
I know exactly how you feel, I wanna keep you real
I never thought that I'd be working for the start 'cause
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all
I don't have the heart, fuck it, I don't have the head
Every time that we're apart, someone's sleeping in my bed
I wanna be alone, I wanna be alone
This fame and fortune shit shows me things I wasn't knowin'
You're my biggest fan, I promise to be there
I wanna be that guy, but I don't think I can
I'm losing everything, I wanna let it go
I wanna take it right and slow because
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it allYeah
This is usually where I would talk but, I don't talk
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Oh, oh, oh
Okay, one for the money, two for the money
I used to write jokes, ain't this shit funny?
Models on me, yes these girls crazy
Gotta take advantage, that is what the fans made me
Shine on these niggas, how these niggas stay shady?
And if you don't see me, you are not star gazing
Play my cards right, I may never meet the dealer
And yes I'm in the building like a horror movie killer
I gotta stay sick, I'd be dead if I was iller
Is it weird going hard when these niggas goin' pillow?
Yep, my life is great, I changed my stars
I re-arrange fate when I rap on bars
Cheezy in the building, hope you niggas missed me
Chilling with these bitches, got my nigga feeling tipsy
Haters mean mugging, face is sour like my whiskey
I don't need a chaser, tell that liquor come and get me
Who'd have thought this rapping make sense, no 50?
And if you're doing great like I am, Say it with me
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I used to be broke, no cash
And them niggas played games, Road Rash
Walking 'round NYU, looking for a dollar
Too proud to ask my friends or my struggling father
So I skate around the city for a couple hours
Dreaming up a day that I could say this world is ours
Now I got some, but I want it all
And I won't stop until Rihanna gives my ass a call
And I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol
Cause this shit hurts, call it the uncle curse
But I'm living for the moment, not the long haul
And I refuse to slow down until its last call
Erykah keeps telling me to grow a conscience
And treat women like money, no object
But these hoes are a much different story
Straight laced chicks don't do nothing for me
I'm in a weird place, I got a little money
But money won't buy you time, If all the time is running from me
There's so much I wanna do, like write a script or write a book
Get an hour on HBO, and date a girl who likes to cook
And stop having all of these crushes on all of my friends girlfriends
I think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends
It looks nice, I gotta get me one of those
I haven't found Mrs. Right, but I'm on it though
Yeah, I'm on it though
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Yes, I'm on it, I'm so on it
Oh, oh, ohWe are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we areDJ Wonder
We gon' rock at least 5 beats, to show your versatility
What you're made of
You gotta rock 5 back, aiight?
Here we go. Childish Gambino, let's go
As the world's turnin', I feel like I'm a worse person
My tongue's hurtin', from all of its work cursin'
And I'm not certain I think my father's Lavar Burton
'Til I'm walkin' in circles and I'm talkin' in third person
In the eighth grade I got high off paper maché
I put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day
Cause shit, ain't nothin' changed
I'm still known as a rude student
That'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shootin'
I can prove it
I'm too cool as a matter of fact
I've been writin' these verses while I'm havin' a heart attack
I'm in your bedroom, crankin' No Doubt and Staring Back
Stereo blaring, Gwen Stefani can holla black
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin
At a Klan rally, wondering why they won't let me in
I'm drunk off this gin and I'm high off Ritalin
Fuck it, let me get to the next beat
I'm the nerdiest rapper ever
I'm wearing a Cosby sweater
And reading Oscar Wilde
Ripping my foreskin to make a washable condom
A bunch of assassins tried to jump me
They couldn't touch me
I rolled off in a yellow Humvee with a bunch of monkeys
My taste buds hate fudge, man
Plus I'm allergic
I'mma dress up like a surgeon so I could hurt Curtis on purpose
And girls see my dick size and they realize
That they can't handle it
I get more sodomy than Tommy Lee and Pam... Anderson?
With my du-rag in my left hand
And my iPod and my diskman
I get more kicks out of it than Jean Claude Van Damm
And I'm still spittin', I'm still hittin'
Big pimpin' like Hova
Yo, let me be the rap...run over
Yea, lemme go, lemme go
Childish Gambino, yo this off the dome
I gotta keep it goin' cause I came from home
Come from Rome, Athens
Or Atlanta, Georgia
Got somethin' for ya
Yes I got some s'mores cause I'll boil you
Like I got that Goya
You know how they play Reggaeton in the beats
When you in NYC
Meaning that me and I'm sickest
Yo, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters Like Ickis
Yo, this chick that I used to lick it
Now her name Aubrey Plaza
I didn't mean to kick it while I'm gettin' salsa
Like I'm eatin' salsa, cause she Puerto Rican
Some people speakin' like she ain't white
But you know that's alright 'cause I keep it tight
Nerdy word murderer in a purple convertiber
Niggas ain't heard of him until his girlfriend converted him
Bitch niggas is Ferguson, I guess I could explain it all
Like all these niggas wanna bone cause you datin' dogs
Or why the radio used to not play me
And why does every white girl love ukelele?
Where I'm from, the Jesus piece couldn't save me
And I'm still spittin' shit cause I'm gettin' like gravy
Eatin' like mashed potatoes, I hate those
Haters who say that I'm not black enough
Yo, you ain't wack enough to fuckin' touch my MC mic
You better keep it tight
Eat a dick like you starvin' homie
Yo, on this last beat I'mma goner
Gotta spit over somethin' hard, like Nirvana
And I'm crazy
With the beat when it comes to this spittin' it
Shittin' it, while I'm lickin' it
I ain't even need to get it
Man these other unC's, they need to get it
Why this LL Cool J shit
Yo I got pesos and mesos
Meaning I can only hack with they ghost
When they go there, when I go back
And I'm still that, I ain't backpack
But you know, with the fuck the rest
Yo they say that is lame like Johnye West
Or Kanye West
But I ain't Kanye West
I'm just tryin' to stay the truth
And I ain't tryin' to spit the truth
Yo, I do what I gotta do in a booth with Sway
Shay45 all day, y'all know what I'm sayin'A kid at the oakland DEEP WEB TOUR stop asked me if i would “change my clothes once i made a million.”
I decided to write this:
I guess i wrote all this to say that my attire is deliberate as much as it isn’t.  clothes aren’t really important.  they’re fun and can accentuate the parts of u or ur personality u want people to notice. i do love and appreciate good, well made/ designed clothes. but they’re not necessary. like a lot of things. like art. like us.  that’s kinda what makes it special
"will u change ur clothes once u reach a million?"
I spent 1.2 million out of my own pockets on the DEEP WEB TOUR before wordpress came in and helped with the rest.  because this tour is me.  we use clothes to make a statement about ourselves. that’s what they’re for.  and my clothes, right now, are me"childish gambino is a white rapper"
­i wanna be a white rapper
­i wanna be so white im the biggest rapper of all time
­i wanna be so white i can have a number one song with cursing and parents are fine with it
­i wanna be so white and so big i get eat dinner with the koch brothers
­i hope I'm so big and white i can go to clippers games and it not be a statement
­i hope I'm so white they let my friend out of jail sooner
­i hope I'm so big and white my cousin wasn’t shot and stabbed twice in the neck twice last month
­i wanna be so big.  so white
­i wanna be so big and and so white that white dads feel comfortable sending their daughters, who are home for the summer from Stanford, to my show
­and after the performance they come hang with me on my bus and we smoke and then we fuck to young dro and she holds my face in her hands and her eyes roll back in her head
­then she goes home and her dad says “how was the show?” and she says “it was fun. they had lasers.”
­i hope i become so big and and so white that G-Eazy  will say “damn, this nigga is white” and everyone will agree and nod
­i want to be so big and white that people are scared.  “what if this spreads?
­what if everyone starts to get big and white?  what if this works for everyone and everyone can experience this whiteness and this bigness?”
­i hope i become too big and too white
­but i am just a black male
­i am a nigga
­twitter activism is wack
­marches don’t work anymore
­police should be forced to wear recording devicesThese guys aren't tough-n-stuff
They can talk that shit when the chips are up
But the chips are down, cause I put them there
And I got a hot chip like the indie band
This is Christmas man and my flow is Miami
And the only gold that I have is my Emmy bitch
Yes and a nigga stay down like I'm in a ditch
These niggas never did shit different, I was tired of it
See the other side of it
Hate how they say how hip-hop is dead and everybody is the same now
I am not the same, how could I ever be?
I am so fly and on fire like a phoenix wing
I go light speed, you go slow pace
And I go hard like G-O in bold face
Used to do me cause I had to, now a nigga like to
Cause I get cheese like the mice do
I'm a work of art, crush niggas like I'm crushing on Annie Clark
They stopped sleeping on me, good morning, like Alonzo
Go ahead and cut that shit out like a tonsil
Yes I stay weird and fuck chicks like I'm Gonzo
Sleeping on a cow pie, tired of the bullshit
Dick is her baby, why does she abuse it?
Eight shots and a beer and I'm passing out
Glasses, leather jacket, I'mma ask you out
Spend the night if you got your own tooth brush
I really think I'd like you, but not too much
I got big plans, yeah I feel myself hard like both hands
Yeah, I feel myself hard like both hands
This is all fun, yeah my work is vacation
Me and six shots, that's a bad combination
I don't need your money, this is free, download it
Play it at a party, watch it pop like a soda
Thick, indie black girl, double stuffed Oreo
Make a shit rapper pissed off like a urinal
You cannot see me, I can change your perspective
Sick boy clique, that's an animal collective
Fuckin' withcha raw, like I don't need protection
I am just a rapper, I'm in search a perfection
Spit hot shit, yeah my mouth is a toaster
Shit look easy like a turd in a short skirt
I am not a fairy-tale, I earned this shit
Leave a track on the stove and watch me burn this bitch
Sick as a dog, fly as an angel
I am just a rapper better learn sign language
Cause I don't talk, yeah I fight, Teddy Ruxpin
Yeah I got paper like I just ate a muffin
This is all wrong man, this is all wrong
Have a nigga have a hit and then they sing the same song
That is so not me, I'mma change it all up
Doctor knows I'm sick dude, I don't need a follow up
Tell me when you can't take the track any longer
Weird Soufflé, yeah the noise makes me stronger
I have gotten stronger, tongue like a shotgun
If you let the track loose, you can watch me pop one
Sick boy bitch and it's back to the future
Cause I'm McFly and it's not what I'm used to
Cause they used to call me other name of a rooster
Sky is the limit, like a jet pack booster
Fuckin' with a nigga like he fuckin' with a time bomb
Can't see a nigga motherfucker turn your eyes on
I am so different y'all don't even know the half of
I do not talk, motherfucker I'm a Rapper!It's royalty
It's royalty
Hey world, this is lollipop, raps for the sweet tooth
The real fiends who want that GhostFace and Sheek Louch
Big chain changlin' charms, they be danglin'
Eighty thou worth of the ice, I'll strangle 'em
My raw fish scale, paid the jeweler named Ishmael
Had to eagle fly back to my wrist
Bigger chips, bigger wings, bigger rings
I'm with the Childish Gambino
On that Eastwood shit, pushin' a Gran Torino
Tarantino don't got reservoir dogs like mine
Thirty six different niggas with the same state of mind
Dirty Ghetto Kids lovin' them haters
We got skaters that'll ox your whole face off
Rob you like Madoff
Drug kingpins on the diet, we get that weight off
Real hood niggas snatch a bitch and clean your plate off
Gambino rap, cash money crack, table casino
Precision cut emeralds, sapphire visualsIn the fourth grade I had a crush on Tia Smith
Sixth grade and this crush is turned to Beatrice
But they don’t like me because I’m too nice
And I’m kinda fat and not the dope type
But I grew out of that and it’s a miracle
Now every girl sees me as marryin’ material
It’s a buyer’s market, I’m Alicia’s target
And every other girl who wanna let me steam their carpet
I love these hipster girls and they feel the same
Now they don’t have to choose when someone asks ‘em Drake or Wayne
And niggas waiting on me, we didn’t have a voice
You used to have to act street and now you’ve got a choice
My momma’s brownie mix, I keep the goodies moist
Of every girl I’m tappin’, this wasn’t supposed to happen
Hard to keep my thoughts straight on every date
Especially when my penis talking SWAT team, cover me, I’m going in
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Yes, I got a million other girls
You don’t wanna hear that for fear that I fuck a lot
And you don’t wanna get attached cause you’ll like me
I fuck a girl named Keira nightly
Nah, I made her up
‘Cause it sounded dope, I don’t give a fuck
Ride me, giddy up
They can hear us in the hall, Arsenio
Naw, girl, I don’t wanna shoot a video
I do it all day, don’t you watch me on the TV show?
I’m gonna get mines any means necessary
Got Red Bull pulsing through my pulmonary
Least I feel like it, met her at a club
Now we’re making out, and I ain’t spend a dub
I’m gonna try to live it up like TOP FLR
And my girls like gifts so I bought more
All girls 18 and over love this light-skinned Casanova
House pimped out, William Sonoma
Sleep on me, that is a coma
Yeah, nigga, you see what I’m gettin’ at
I’m gettin’ at her, I’m hittin’ that
Her kitty cat purr, how weird is that?
I’m diggin’ that
A nigga not tryin’ to say you don’t make mistakes
I’m trying to fix all the hearts I break
But every time that we talk in my apartment
We’re gonna kiss a little, and then we start shit
“You’re heartless, don’t call again
Don’t email, we can’t be friends
I swear that this is the end”
Then I call her next week and we do it again
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls
(I don’t mean to seem like I care about material things, like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls
Ow!)

I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls
Ow!)Yes, I'm Mr. Big Stuff
Yeah, my stuff big, man
Keep a girl's pussy bright red like a pig's tan
Four shots and watch me lean like a kick stand
I really need to change my name to, "Hey, I'm a big fan!"
Cause that's all I hear when I'm outside
And my hoodie's never jealous of that tie-dye
Cheesy on the mic, like I'm laying on Jordan
No homo for you niggas homophobic
Yes, I back bend these girls aerobic
And these hoes got a Spiderman like Tobey
Keep these girls wet, call them Lakers like Kobe
Got money trees, asking me, "Do you grow me?"
Latin girls kiss my feet like they're Superga
Latin girls see your face and call you "stupida"
Yes my name is Childish, so I guess I'm cheesy
Yes yes yes my wallet's cheesy
Throw your hood up, are you queasy?
Yes, I am the Juggernaut
Yes, my name is Elroy
Yes, my dick will make that ho tell, like a bell boy
And I get my tip, and my tip is in your girl
And I'm gonna bust a nut like I'm a Gallagher squirrel
It's the man of the hour
Better yet, the century, check the whiskey sour
Lookin' like I'm drinkin' piss
How's he fuckin' thinkin' this
Easy, I'm a mentalist, but I'm not on CBS
Uh, yes it's me Bam-B
What is your daughter to do?
I've been doing this ever since Harry Potter was new
Boy! I don't play, I change games, I am too real
So my words stay hard like a blue pill
I like pink, it always looks good on me
And I like pink, it always looks good on me
That second part I was talking about vagina, homie
Fuck the game at an early age, now there hymen on me
Yes, I am a magnet
Yes, I do attract it
Remember when these fake ass niggas called me faggot?
Cause I had glasses and a pink track jacket
Now those things are assets to help me get some asses
Now these nerdy hoes keep asking me to smash it
Bullies from middle school chatting on my Twitter status
Fuck you, you don't get shit from now on
Unless you got a demo tape, then I can lay some brown on
It's the B to the AMBI, colors like candy
Nigga, I'm the Army. I'm being all I can be
Yes I dress dandy. Get a Klu, like the Klan B
I live hard, I never sleep in, like an Amby
This is for the niggas thinkin' different
While their friends are flippin' pigeons in they're stay po-pimpin'
He never lets the best go past him
My life says yes like it's having orgasmsNew shit alert! New clothes
Got a new whip, homie I got two of those
Got some green, homie we got UFO's
We the new chick, Royalty man, you ain't know?
Somebody tell 'em we ain't never going nowhere
Mr. CEO, I give a fuck about a co-chair
He fly, no fair, tell 'em how we did it, though
Droppin' with the hottest shit, no time to do the video
ATL is my city, though, East Side bitch
Getting Cortez at Stonecrest, I'm East Side rich
But my old girl Laconia, my house California
You ain't heard the news? D-Money back on ya
Niggas wanna network, cause I'm the only rapper with his face on a network
Fuckin' check my net worth tell 'em what the check's worth
Go and let 'em know
Touch down and I leave your city tore up
Then I'm coming home to my girls on the tour bus
But then I'm gone again, more shows, more bucks
Ten times your cut, bein' broke sure sucks
Opportunity, I've never seen a door shut
Get it for my fam so my daddy ain't a Warbuck
Summer coming so I hit 'em with the warm up
Ballin' in my sweat suit, I'm tryin' to get my form up
I ain't think we was ballin' 'til private jets to New Orleans
My girlfriend on and on 'em, caught 'em fallin' like Autumn
God damnit, yeah get up on it yeah man the truth hurts
Think fast, shoot first, beast like blue fur
All we do is do this, yeah
Ay, ay
Childish Gambino
Here we go, Harry Fraud
Yo we got a shout out for him
Yo
Jesus, he's still around? That makes two of us
Rappers who fuckin' hate me still wanna stop my tour bus
Rappers who call me gimmick still post me and troll the comments
20 shots of that honesty, I'm tryin' to control the vomit
Ugh, nauseum, eat a dick, all of 'em
'Bino does it feel good? Is East Side still hood?
Haters never mutual, boy that's for your man's sake
I don't see it like a Pusha-T and Wayne handshake
Pop or flop mobsters, we ain't do neither
Why these dudes want a mixtape, Shaq Diesel?
The truth is what you make it and lately, it's hard to find
Will they remember "Heartbeat" like it was "Party All the Time"?
I know, I know, I know, it's that run it back
I just rocked 10K, where my hundred at?
My homie reppin' K.Flay at the Summer Jam
And they show me love somethin' serious
And I was just a kid, man, I ain't think they hearin' us
And Mase shook my hand and I'm shook
Cause my man still with Biggie and Gambino just a fan
I'mma tell you something true
If you ain't got a bunch of haters, man, then you ain't doing you
And this fake fuckin' rappers wanna fire shots for no reason
I could've helped you, but fuck it, I'm callin' open season
This ain't subliminal, I'm comin' right at you
But no one knows who you are, so I'm rapping at fuckin' statues
You gassed cause you got a meetin'? Crew is a never heard of you
Your drive is a learner's permit, your beef is a veggie burger
Verbal murder? Nah, we just tell what the truth homie
I'm with my girl in Spain, what are you doing?
Fuck it boy, we don't get enough joy
Watchin' everyone I know makin' major bok choy
Royalty, only two of us are fuckin' rappers
Another runs Wordpress, another does Apple
Another's DT and drinkin', talkin', on that cheddar
You wonder who we are, that means you already met us
I'm everywhere nigga, I don't need the fuckin' throne
I don't need Illuminati, I could fucking start my own
Cause I'm Childish, Childish, Childish
Childish Gambino
Westwood, Westwood, so its all good
Yo Childish Gambino, East Side let 'em knowI do not talk, I am just a rapper
Stompin' on these niggas like a whack-a-mole with no hands
Get girls on the floor like slow jams
Fuck yeah, I'm feelin' myself, no lotion
My light shine bright, no roaches
Nigga, I'm focused
You the one who eyes wrong
Only time I'm worried is when I'm the no-fly zone
Cause I'm so fly, homes
Fresh like pinecones
Female phone book my iPhone
Margarita bright, meanin' limelight
Nerd girls losin' their shit like prom night
Mouth like a pussy, it can never be too tight
Let me guess, you know a better rapper you, right?
Bam-B
Sicker than your grandma
Pass the mix-tape to a friend like Chandler
This track is gettin' over written:
'Sports Night' banter
Tell 'em that you know me when you runnin' through Atlanta
I am at the top
Whether you want or not
And I am in my prime
I am an autobot
I do not talk a lot
I am just a rapper
Fuck a girl's pussy bright red like snapper
Sick
Yeah, I stay fly like a pelican
Get new kicks everyday like an ottoman
Ex-girlfriends askin' if they get a shot again
I try to call 'em back but there's a lot of them
Someone tell me why these muthafuckers busy hatin' me
Just because I'm rappin' and my style is kinda Japanese
Band of outsiders
Kitsune, APC
Macy's got shit on me
Fuck what you heard like a dick inside alarm clock
I ain't got no jewelry, I leave it at the pawn shop
Two of your chains equals one of my shirts, sir
You got Jacob's Jeweler, I got Anna Wintour
Niggas jealous cause I got more green than seven splinters
I'd rather spend that money on a polo from La Tigre
Young, smart, and handsome
Who could even ask for more?
I change the situation like auditioning for Jersey Shore
I'm the prince, put your crown on the ground 
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh
Sick
I'm the prince, put your crown on the ground 
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh
SickI am the shit
I hold heat like cigarettes
No one else is doing this
Work this hard you get respect
I don't sleep, I dream awake
Swear this life's like make or break
I don't make I fix mistakes
Your life good, my life is great
This game is a bitch and I'm different, dude
I'm tryin' to fuck this bitch, she ain't in the mood
Seduce her quick
Everyone talkin' bout game needs change ain't changin' shit
Talk don't make it happen
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Too tight need muscle relaxer
I'm what's next, just ask 'em
All I know
It's what I came for
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah
All I know
It's what I came for
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah
I wanna do this right
Leave my heart on stage when I hold a mic
And the game OT, no end in sight
So I write in my sleep, I don't say good night
This must be how the angels felt
I hope that I don't Corey Haim myself
I know that I drink an insane amount
'Cause it helps with the joy and the pain of wealth
These guys don't seem like the friends I need
And they hang backstage drinking beers for free
My mom and my dad in the balcony
The one time that I hope they look down on me
'Cause they proud of me
They call me a role model
Even though my hand glued to that gin bottle
I keep my career going full throttle
Even though the pain will follow
All I know
It's what I came for
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah
All I know
It's what I came for
Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, yeahThis that, fire!
It's your man Bambino, Sick Boi thriller
King of fly rappers, there ain't none iller
I'm into fly sneakers, colors like Gullies

They call me Sick Boi cause they know I'm so sick
Purple on my starter cap, yellow on my kicks
Haters talkin' shit, they think they so slick
And if you don't like my style: "Eat a dick"
I'm a younger Denzel, say it ain't so
I'm all puffed up like I'm made of Afros
But my neck ain't froze, where's the boy's jewelry?
Don't need it nigga, clothes bright, shine beautifully
Used to sport Airs then I had to get Grind
Now I look great, now I'm top of the line
Used to go hungry when I'd buy them new shoes
Now I'm like "Mm..food" like MF Doom
Busy makin' moves like my name was Tetris
Money in the bank, you can check my mattress
Bright like Mantis and I ain't selfish
I got the game shook like a young black Elvis

That's like - fucking Kat Stacks with no condom
Stupid, everybody out here needs to cool it
Rap stepfather, no more hanging in the pool shit

When you were the shit it was loose in this bitch
Drinks, drugs, chicks and Uggs
Weirdos sipping Cuervo or that Indica
Grown man singing "Where is the Love"
Who the fuck no grown man?
Young boys who make no sense
Young girls with that old chest
Now I'm like oh yes, oh yes
Reflex
We just go squirrel shit
That's nuts, ask us

Body so tight
And like that

Got a few girls and they white-black
Red-yellow, few brown
So I beat it up like Knockout
And she ain't last for like 2 rounds
It's the new sound
For strippers and students to get down
Just hits now
Fly ladies get loose with it
All the bourgie bitches just sit down
These mixed girls with two-tones
With the nice bodies, they too toned
Came here with like five girls
That'll circle-twerk with no shoes on
Like: work
Damn baby, you don't need a holiday
She got a body language you know what that body say
Tattoos on her body like that body paint
Drop it low, bring it up I bet you everybody say:
This G shit: gold chains and a v-neck
Yeah we flex, star status
Do the whole world with no regrets
Just G jets
Concepts, this type of shit you ain't seen yet
Did a whole tour for like six months
So the game mine, no reset
Fast money, my reflex
These fly beats, that's Reflex
Killin' the shit for like, how long?
Y'all give me my respect?
Got skills man, I'm sayin'
These young chicks, I raise em
She fine now but in three years
I bet the whole style'll be amazing
Like
Give her three years I bet that body right
Coppin' clothes better now she know her body type
Her ex-man, trippin' wishin' that he got it right
Get a body bag, she killin' everybody like:Whoa!
What'd you get, amnesia?
I bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was Lil' Weezy, huh?
Bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was in a band or something
And my bank balance were around a grand or something
Ask you something:
Do you think I'm common like sense is?
That heaven didn't send this
Uniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then
But you know, I know, I'd make a damn good boyfriend
Oil can, oil can
You think I'm the Tin Man
You took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can
Ain't you heard I got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?
In the lean time don't come crying for the thin man
In the meantime I'll be building my portfolio
All these other dudes eradicated like polio
With any luck you'll see me everywhere like Starbucks
I bet you'll wanna fuck me when it's time to star fuck
I didn't have green like an Arizona front lawn
Now they try to touch my face like an iPhone
Now I'm all gassed up like Exxon
Girls see the money like I fucking got checks on
I don't even know if this girl really likes me
Picking up the check like I'm working at Nike
Talking to this girl and I'm thinking that she's into me
Then I find out she's trying to break in the industry
That's really lame
I still hit it
But I refuse to be home girl's meal ticket
I'm looking for a sick girl to be a part of me
Not a girl who will try to McCartney me
Yes, homie I'm a man of my word
Got this shit in the can like a toilet of turd
And, yes, these gold diggers trying to get at my sperm
Well, I'm not a 49ers fan, in case you haven't heard
I know my girl out there somewhere
And if you hear this, you should come here
Unless you don't give head like a weird beer
Elroy, Bam-B, yeah, I'm outta hereSee I be riding through my old hood, same old attitude
Chillin with your girlfriend, why she always mad at you
She be like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Only time that she quiet, when my thing is inside her
Don't you know I'm a writer
Yeah, I sleep in her stomach
And I slip her a 50, just to keep her 100
Yeah, my swaggers so dummy
We so stupid, so silly
I watch them girls getting lower than the kick in "A Milli"
Gambino, why you got a gold chain?
Cause girls only gonna see you when you stuntin, man
I'm coming back, swag on Rogaine
Girl lemme see you 2 Chainz old name
So hood, what y'all talking bout
Man, I'm watching Law and Order on my grandma's couch
Eating Lucky Charms for dinner, loser to a winner
Swag so Clippers, me and Blake Griffin
Me and Blake Griffin, why your goals dripping
You ever seen ballas like us po' pimping?
Ha, we getting drunk like a Kennedy
Ha, we stay fly like the end of Grease
Yeah, I got Os like CP3
Don't worry, don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me
I'm only worried when that period's on CPT
When that period's on CPTI do not talk
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Childish Gambino, hot as a flaming Cheeto
I'm tighter than baby speedos
I'm shifting another kilo
And that's because my shits dope
Walking past the red rope
The bouncer is my kin folk
So I don't need credentials
Sick boy is my clique
I got that shit inside a headlock
Love to make that bam bam
We were born to make the bed rock
I am so hip hop
More so than you guys
I am legend
You guys are true lies
Tipsy like some Jenga
Shout out to my topangas
Them thicky thick girls stay wrapped around my finga
Nerdy girls from every where
They scope me out like there he is
My whole crew's sick
I'm hanging out with Jerry's Kids
Hold up mother fucker
It's gambini on the microphone
Screaming like your father when he comes home and the light are on
Girls addicted to my dick
My wallet is their methadone
Brain dead niggas love beef
They are vegetables
I am on that fly shit
Fuck that, I'm orbiting
My face is everywhere
Fuck that, I'm Norbiting
I can feel your heat, momma
I can hear your feet, mommaOh, I wish I had a boyfriend
I wish I had a loving man in my life
I wish I had a father
Maybe then I would’ve turned out right
But now I’m just crazy, and totally mad
Yeah I’m just crazy, fucked up in the head
And maybe if I really tried with all of my heart
Then I could make a brand new start in love with you
Oh, I wish I had a suntan
I wish I had a pizza and a bottle of wine
I wish I had a beach house
Then we could make a big fire every night
But now I’m just crazy, and totally mad
Yeah I’m just crazy, fucked up in the head
And if I really tried with all of my heart
Then I could make a brand new start in love with you, in love with you
Listen to my mouth, nigga I meant it
Don’t fuck with me unless you want your swag pregnant
A nigga bad grammar, I run on sentence
I am just a rapper, so I don’t need practice
I am just different, I eat/sleep genius
Forever I love Atlanta, I stunt these Filas
Swag celibate, I don’t fuck with these bitches
Smoke these niggas, turn ‘em all swishers
Can’t make up my mind I gotta fuck both sisters
And my flow is retarded, I spit autism
Got that shit to make ya bounce like Tigger
‘Cause I am more childish than “good job” stickers
Your girl’s in the room so I don’t have any jeans on
We are at war, so my wallet is the Green Zone
We can do this shit, any time, anywhere
And you know you aren’t me and I know it isn’t fair
Yeah, these niggas apple trees, they need to grow a pair
I balled in the store, but nigga, I got hair
And as soon I got here, the girls act different
But I don’t have to act, I’ve been different for a minute, mothafuckerY'all know the name
No action, all flame
It's D to the C, no practice, all game
And not the game that your computer came installed with
So ditch the lame Twit you are currently involved with
The Derrick Boys a bunch of crazy brothers like the Baldwins
Echo motherfucker, you are just another dolphin
Hello motherfucker, like I walked in on incest
Do it motherfucker, talking does not impress
Us, man, us
It's all about us
Like them self absorbed teen girls talking on the bus
We trust you to pay when we ask you to pay
Til then, Chili Peppers, we give it away
I don't fuck the fans, I am not the industry
Man, I hate it when the man comes between you and me
I don't masturbate, I give a handjob to a star and
Picture you bumping out this anthem in your car
Still showing up for our dorks, geeks, losers
Rode out from New York on six beach cruisers
And if we could we'd ride with every kid right on the handlebars
We are just some rappers like some fat kid ate the candy bars
Yes I'm back with a whole new attitude
Flier than a Cardinal, check my fuckin' latitude
Yes I'm so sick man, somebody call the doctor
Girls stay wet like I'm fucking with a lobster
I stopped talking I'm tired of paying em lip service
Switched over them street niggas to hipsters
I am so different, Donald Glover in the bitch
I don't need to use my rapper name, that's just Childish
And they used to call me Oreo, dunk me in that milk
Maybe then I will be white enough to hang out with them kids
They have to call you names when they don't know what you are
Now they know just what I are, baby girl I am a star
APC kicks, looking like a British boy
More money means more problems, I have been annoyed
Dude mad bout the girl that I came with
I'm fly, she fly, you are just penguin
I am just a rapper so I don't speak English
I just go hard like the traffic light changes
Sick boy, bitch, we the clique like seat belts
Yes I'm on fire I don't have to ask how heat felt
When I was 14, man nobody else was thinking this
A nigga off the chain, man I Abraham Lincoln'd this
I am just different
Motherfucker, I'm different
Yeah, I am just different
Yeah, I am just differentI do not talk, I am just a rapper
I am just a rapper
Gambino keep it jumping
These niggas don't know nothing
I keep a girl shaky like her pussy lips is krumping
It's that dude that don't say shit
Leave the ad-libs at the door
Because I am just a rapper like the condoms on my floor
Nigga look at me
Man, yeah I'm all geeked out
Got the tortoise shell frames, Tom Ford pea coat
I'm a lot more dope, I'm a lot more fly
And my wallet stay fat, but I starve my tie
Yeah, these girls loose change
Gotta spend those dimes
Haven't seen real niggas in a long ass time
Nigga I'm so stange, so weird, unusual
Sipping on that whiskey, it's a brain cell funeral
I'll tell you why I'm different, I do this like a nun
Cause I don't give a fuck, I do this shit for fun
A nigga All That like I'm hanging out with Kel
Yes, I hit her g-spot, so I ring her Taco Bell
I got a lot of swagger, lets me get away with all of it
Like I ate a turd, real shit is all I nigga spit
I don't play around with these women, I might fuck a bitch
The game's a corporation and your nigga's Erin Brockovich
I'm murdering this beat as if nobody was watching me
Rapping over Grizzly Bear and now these hipsters sponsor me
My mouth is this good, just imagine what my dick can do
Force Feed Radio, bitch that's what you're listening to
My girl wears Pampers, I fuck the shit out of her
'Bout to blow up, yeah my swag is the Challenger
These Scrubs are reclusive, J.D, Salinger
March on these niggas like they fucking with the calendar
If I wasn't this good, how the fuck did I get this far?
Gambino stay fly. So up, I'm Pixar
Hold up dude, I think you made a mistake
Don't forget to mention me with Wale, Cudi and Drake bitchIs it my turn, to wish you were lying here?
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
Even imagine your emotions, tell myself anything
Is it my turn, to hold you by your hands?
Tell you I love you and I hear you
Is it my turn to totally understand?
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing
If I have to give away the feeling that I feel
If I have to sacrifice, whatever baby, whatever baby
If I have to take apart all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do
‘Cause inside i’d die without you
Oh Oh baby I’d die without you
Die without you
Oh, I apologize for all the things I’ve done
But now I’m underwater and I’m drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry
Isn’t it amazing how some things completely turn around
So take every little piece of my heart
Piece of my heart
Take every little piece of my soul
Piece of it
Take every little piece of my mind
Cause if you don't
Inside
I’d die without you
Die without you
Yeah baby

If I have to give away
The feeling that I feel

My germs in your system, now you coughin’ like asthmatic
All of my, I’m tired of it turns into your, wish I had it

She said this dick is hers, I don’t wanna take it from her
Your dick stay chilly, it’s a cold, rough world
I get superhero pussy, she a PowerPuff Girl
Shit just got real like Pinocchio turds
Yo nigga is Geppetto, I don’t want no instrumentals
Leave the vocals on my shit
Like the song givin’ me head
And your bitch can’t sleep ‘cause she used to my bed
She could have any dick, you just mad she chose-d mine
Schoolin’ all you niggas and my mouth will make it Columbine
I am just a rapper, man, I ain’t got no clothing line
My clothing line has closed the line and let me shop at closing time
Yo boy got stacks like I’m standin’ in a Borders line
Hidin’ from you bitches ‘cause real nigga’s hard to find
Work this shit like overtime
Yeah, my clothes are so designed
Closet look like Bloomingdales, yo closet look like fashion jail
I break you out, I post for bail
This money make me Olsens, you call your bitch, you hearin’ this
Uh uh uh
Yes it’s necessary to be flier than canaries
Stay fresh to death like a mint cemetery
I do not talk, yeah my life a library
Eat her out and leave her cold, make that hole my Ben & Jerry’s
Broke the mold on you bitches, man, I am so unique
You are not a rapper, if you were you’d hardly speak
I am Stone Mountain and I haven’t reached my peak
Fuck her like I’m mad at her then I turn the other cheek
This shit is amazin', check me in my sweater, man
Comme des Garçons, bitch, nobody do it better, man
But I do it better, man
When it comes to pussy girls whisper in my ear
No one else can do this to me
You’s a cutie but you gotta know I’m married to my work
And these niggas ain’t shit so I guess they must be urine
Gotta gift this bitch, like Christmas, bitch
I’ma rap and act, Will Smith this bitch
When rappers start rappin’ over indie shit
Just remember I was first to hit this shit
The difference is I’m different, bitch
How the fuck can these niggas be dick-less pricks
Man, what the fuck you gon’ do
I don’t need to talk to you
I am just a rapper tooMapquest where the place is
Gats in they faces
Then we fold them up and put them back in they cases
Assassins replace expressions on faces
And hard eyes on gangsters with hot gaping spaces
Hands full of aces, pockets on swole
Glassy-eyed aiming from my own grassy knoll
Leave JFK’s head just a big smoky hole
To console Jackie O she could smoke my pole
It’s called Camelot ‘cause she came a lot
And a lot of you rappers sound the same a lot
And the game is still out there if you play or not
And I’m the King of Queens, Kevin James is not
I quit my temp job ‘cause I can’t let a day go
Tomorrow’s moguls are delivering your bagels
I hope your trophy wife been practicing her Kegels
Cause when we take the game we won’t leave you any Legos
There go the kid with his dirty white sneakers on
Dreaming on a way to get his penthouse on Bleecker on
Give your girl head, call you with the speaker on
Horse head in your bed, now you know who you sleeping on
Are you seeing what I’m seeing?
This booth is a crime scene
Chalk off the mic, the kill screen is my screen
No need to terrify or pop shots at witnesses
They only testified they know what hot shit this is
True assassins
Hold your glass up
Them's the type of niggas that’ll cut yo ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses
Chains or purses
Them the type of niggas that’ll make you stop
True assassins
Hold your glass up
Them's the type of niggas that’ll cut yo ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses
Chains or purses
Them the type of niggas that’ll make you stop
Classic assassin
Straight from Central Castin’
I bust through your abode with both barrels blastin’
I crush up your skull like a truck that you crashed in
I’m never gonna die like I’m Tuck Everlasting
Never thought that I’d carry an AK
All I ever wanted to be is Farley, Ferrell, or Fey
And maybe some day that dream will come true
But for now I got my gun and I’m aiming at you 
In your house on your couch while you’re readin’
I got no flow, it’s more like breakthrough bleedin’
But I’m into cartoons and I’m really not sane
All I leave of your body is a Pinky and the Brain 
I’m more Manson than a small-time crook
When it comes to taking lives I steal like Dane Cook
Bitch, take a look, you know it’s in a book
Even LeVar Burton’s Roots get shook
Ah, ah, you can call me assassin, I kill Versace
I walk too much, gotta Gucci watch me
The illest of the killers you can tell by my fashion
Light hoodie to bright sneaks it’s all matchin'
I kill rappers, I don’t need no stealin’
If I do lose a battle I’mma kill ‘em for real
I’m just kidding, or am I?
Things get real in the City of L.I
That’s right, I live in Queens
The borough of the lost
I hate the fuckin’ yuppies but I love how much it costs
Call me in the winter and the spring to play tennis
And they give me strange looks ‘cause I floss like a dentist
I’mma finish this sentence then get me a rope
So I got a little dough and I’m fresh like Scope
A nigga so dope, I got the new Pumas
I never take 'em out so I call ‘em homeschoolers
Numbers like rulers, I’m tired of it all
I sleep in the club and I yawn when I ball
I’m off the hook like phone calls
Where’s Kidrobot?
I need a new hoodie hot pink like doughnuts
The kids is Go-Gurts when they see my Gobstoppers
I’m not Mekhi Phifer, but I got Clockers
Transform a watch when I don’t got diamonds
Boy, did you hear what I said like Simon?
I kill boutiques
Just snatch the new sneak
I’ma do it every week
I’m a serial killer
Beats like Dilla
Hun like ‘Tilla
It’s the Sick Boi Thrilla 
True assassins
Hold your glass up
Them's the type of niggas that’ll cut yo ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses
Chains or purses
Them the type of niggas that’ll make you stop
True assassins
Hold your glass up
Them's the type of niggas that’ll cut yo ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses
Chains or purses
Them the type of niggas that’ll make you stopFeel it comin' in the air 
Hear the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down 
Got a problem tell me now 
Only thing that's on my mind 
Is who's gonna run this town tonight? 
Is who's gonna run this town tonight? 
We gonna run this town 
Yea, the flow so absurd
It's C.G. boy, king of the black nerds
I gotta get my Urkel on
I won't stop until I see an afro at Comic-Con
And not just Samurai
I was an outcast, nickname Aquemini
The wait's over, like two pounds over scale
I'm doing big things like I'm eating out a whale
These niggas do the same shit because they scared to fail
I'm in a hot pink hoodie, I ain't ever scared
These niggas frontin', sayin' like "he gay and shit"
And then they wonder why nobody wanna play they shit
Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-heyyy-hey-hey-heyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-hey-hey-heyyy
We are, yea I said it we are
Nigga I'm a soldier, trooper like I'm VR
Where's my fuckin' key card
It was right behind me
Fuck it, home girl you can blow me in the lobby
My girl loves brains, so she is my zombie
Na home boy, I don't practice, this my hobby
They all say make a demo tape so they can sign me
Cause yo boy stay mo hot than Gandhi
Listen up 
I don't do this for the limelight
I do this for kids who get picked on for talkin' white
I do this for kids who rock out to The White Stripes
If you a nigga with glasses and skateboards, I got you right 
It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To get here, it takes guts like the aggro
Crag
They used to call me fag
Cause I ain't wanna be on the corner holdin' the bag
"Well fuck them niggas, they only holdin' you back"
Said a little voice inside of me wearin' a yellow cap
Or maybe it was bright pink, I can't remember
Alls I know I wrote my first verse that December
Now I'm so sick boy, yea I'm straight loungin'
Niggas used to say "who?" like I'm Pete Townshend
Yea, it's hard to stay grounded
When you're Andre and MST 3000
All rolled into one nigga
I 69 a 49er boy, gold diggers
I grind all day to stay alive
So I guess I'm a Mac with a hard drive
If you think you hype now, see the boy live
Bright colors in the streets like I'm gay pride
Yea my hoodie look like it drank five alive
And these dudes play my shit like I'm Goldeneye
If you could see the best, go be it
And if I die young nigga so be it
Like I told you on the other track
If there's a dude tight as me, I ain't seen him yet
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-heyyy-hey-hey-heyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Hey-hey-hey-heyyy
Heeeey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy
We gon' run this town tonightI do not talk, I am just a rapper
Nigga, I'm the capper
Rapper slash not actor
Cause I could never act the part of being fakey
You should really thank me
Who else would do this shit?
All that fucking wishing and waiting
These niggas are mistaken
You don't speak my language
Dressed like I'm Cambridge
Bowtie make me Muslim
Switch it for suspenders
Two at least
Clickin' through on hypebeast
Thom Browne, Hells Bells, Kitsune, Jay L
I don't wear shit unless it got a logo
Now it's time to go and walk around SoHo
All high schools showing out, Pay less
Man fuck that, yo I earned this
I love clothes

Go to TOPMAN, that's the hot spot
Check Kanye's blog for the high tops
Check shake appeal lookbook right quick
Bape hooking up with Ambush, that’s sick
Sperry top-sider with a black trim
Pink leather jacket, gotta get him
New t-shirt and I put it all
On a charge card
Burning through my Goyard
And it's so dumb, but it's so tight
Ain't nothing like new shoes every night
And it feels so good in the new jeans
And the new shirt, it's addicting
I'm an addict, I don't want help
I'mma die in my brand new Louis belt
But not Louis, it's too gaudy
Check the lime green frames a girl bought me
Billionaire Boys Club, I'm living it
One shirt, eight dubs, I'm spending it
Got shoes that I know I won't wear
And the problem is I don't really care
Got money, but nothing is forever
Every time I'm out to buy a new sweater
By 211 I'll be dead broke
I'll be the homeless dude in a peacoat
I love clothes
I love clothes
I love clothes
I love clothesMr. DNA, flow so Jurassic
Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic
Damn right we got a t-rex, I paid for that in plastic
Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic
Mistake still burning but I'm learning like a raptor
Take what I'm given make it work like an adapter
Make short work of her, then I will adapt her
Critics all agree it was the work of a master
At last my success will match my fatigue
And at last I'll send my children to an ivy league
In the masks from The Strangers, freak the whole place out
Get your glasses on, girl, geek your whole face out
Don't open up your mouth unless to let something great out
And that's not a beef, that's just a peek at the steakhouse
A week at my maid's house to recharge my battery
Then I'll be right back on top like Slattery
You know from Sterling and Cooper
If she's paid out then I will recoup her
And if she's paid out then I will invest
And if she's really played out then I will impress
Upon her the need to please please me, whoa yeah
Girl I'm on my knees, Ooh, I need it so bad
It's like I work at NORAD
It's DEFCON-5
Go out back to my car and drive
Cause shit just got real
Take a thirty wreck drive into a field
Pass out in my vehicle
Hope I wake up in a world more agreeable
Hope I wake aboard unidentified flying objects
Or a reject Enterprise
A Starfleet drop out odyssey
A route to cop out galaxies
'Til then I'm in the light, right where the moths are
Impressive, depressive I'm a Goth Star
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Nigga I'm on
Niggas try to off me
Like these girls like I like my coffee
In my lap Fuck this track
It goes off beat but I'm on like clap
And dog, you can have my scraps
I'm close to these girls like her tampon flaps
I'm having an effect on the hood like crack
Even though I'm so suburban like a backpack strap
Don't you get it? Read Ayn Rand
Then you'll understand why they call me the man
I'm just fucking special-er
Different from you other guys
Hating me in high school made me metamorphosize
Kafka-esque, The way I dress
I need to send Bo Diddley some checks
On Marc Jacobs, Commes Des Garcon tie
Diddy is my swagger coach, can't stop, won't stop
Heavy hitter, short stop, horse face, horse cock
Bouncer, door stop, tell me when enough's enough
Looking at me warming up, microwave a nigga flow
Pity y'all don't see me though the rest of y'all already know
I get it like I gotta, man, Flier like a college band
Niggas looking for a deal and I cut out the middle man
Drinking fucking grape juice, early at a wine bar
Blacker than Depeche Mode so I'm a Goth StarI’m cooler than an ice cube, yeah I’m rude
‘Bout to get your head sliced, yeah I’m nice
And you ‘bout to pay the price
Like The Price Is Right, but I’m not Bob Barker
Yes, I get down like I’m Charlie Parker
Meaning that I’m musically inclined
If you try to get with mine I’m about to blow yo head back
Get another bullet and I spray bullet 
And I spray back, pop, pop, click, click  down
Now they lookin’ for your body like all over the town
Niggas, my name Gambini, I used to be clean
Now I’m dirty martini, ‘cause this boy met world like Feeny
These niggas make wishes like genie
Nigga you know how we do
Latinos, black people, and gringos
This money stained my fingers like Cheetos
Blast it out your speakers like credo
‘Cause I can barely hold it all in like Speedos
These niggas got a lot of nerve
These niggas got a lot of sneaks
And all these skinny bitches busy shop at Anthropologie
Who you tryin’ to be?
I’mma take my girls to BIM and treat ‘em like a VIP
Because I am a G, ugh 
I start the party like Chex Mix
Put it in your house like Netflix
Beef, nigga, it’s what’s for breakfast
Y’all niggas got beef with this kid
Y’all niggas’ punks and stay punks like the Misfits
I'm way off in the distance
Y’all done lost the race like McCain
But like McCain, you used to be cool but now you lame
It’s hard to maintain ain’t it?
Because I am so much better 
My swag is so sick, you might catch it
I’m tired of fuckin’ ‘round with little kids like I’m Brad Pitt
These little kids need to play in traffic
‘Cause all they words make a nigga giggle like Mad Libs
I’m hot like an attic in the summer
And girls scream “Sick Boi” like we know each other
But we don’t know each other, you ain’t my fucking brother
We need to separate like organic peanut butter
My lightsaber flashing, my kneecaps ashy
And girls of the world used to walk right past me
Now I hang with girls like my girl Kate Perry
I might have to marry Kate like my name Ashley
These rappers don’t know what they up against
They can’t see a nigga like my names Snuffleupagus
If you don’t like my shit, why the fuck you bumpin’ this?
I am so much better 
You better get it clean good ‘cause this the last straw
And break inside your house and leave your gas on
Nigga, we NASA, ‘cause we ‘bout to blast off
Go in the bathroom, we see you peein’ like I’m Shasta McNasty
Get it? UPN? Shasta McNasty?
Nigga, I’m a master
And I’m fucking plastered
I don’t need a fucking beat for this, I can make my shit up
While I go here’s the part that I’m about to show ya
I’m the best ‘cause I gotta
The devil wears Prada
And he’s got a boom boom like Welcome Back, Kotter
Leave your guy like Madonna
Got cheese like frittata, green ensalada
Got ya, mama
Most rappers want the drama, but I don’t want the drama
I just want a quiet night down at Benihana
I rap ‘cause I gotta
Dude’s got nada
I make ‘em all proud like my middle name ObamaStreet niggas, hood rats, ladies and gentlemen
Childish Gambino greater than sign everyone
Apples to oranges, Jay Leno to Letterman
Got a cool whip and my girl ass gelatin
"Fake niggas back in style" no never that
If I'm wrong, see you in hell with hella cash
God dammit we the boys with the illest rain
Royalty forever and the rest is just a silly game
Still learnin' how to work your girlfriend's genitals
Still buyin' sweaters off of 30 Rock residuals
Money change everything, these bitches always down to ride
Especially if you keep they nose gentrified
Money off of curse words, I hope my mama's proud of me
Man, I've done it all, so I guess we both prodigies
From PJs to PJs, that's projects to privates
Now you understand my fuckin' mindset, let 'em know
I know you want my head to roll, my body on that dirty curb
My rap music's dead and gone, niggas want me in the dirt
I bust your little bubble, shatter your dreams
And push you over in my bottomless pit of sixteens
Alchemist rapper transform on your shape-shift
Cause if it never dawned on you, I'm a snake bitch
The great serpent is tatted on my fist
Kundalini Key on the pyramid
This is meditated murder, my aura that over-lifer
He escaped out the belly like it's been a long time, son
Surprise son, I'm back for you motherfuckas' soul you owe me
We made a blood pact when you stole my style
Nigga straight bit my swag
But I'm a demon, I get even when I take mine's back
I'm a god in the flesh, all this power I possess
I crush you little pussies like sex, who's next?
I'm sittin' on a bunch of green faces
So my wallet is an alien invasion
Or a spaceship, my crew's the illest
So we Aaahh!!! real monsters, Nicktoons Ickis
That line's the stupidest, but it be lucrative
I'm sellin' out these venues, niggas gotta get used to it
Now fuckin' with the realest that you ever had
And P my motherfuckin' nigga so I call him dad
Yeah I'm a motherfucker too, birthed a lot of sons
Get a lot of money, spent it on a lot of guns
I'm trying to change, I don't want to scare away execs
Clean me up, but you can't change what's in my head
Killin’ Glenlivet, Dom P said it
My flow go to earth, we the ill pandemic
We smoke the whole barn up, bitch I'm on my high horse
You don't watch Community? Girl, what is you lyin' for?
Bitch, I got immunity
Out here in the jungle of concrete
Where I hustle gettin' all these rhymes off
Hoes wanna jump, but I don't want your little dyke
I'm too preoccupied with this good life
I want a hood life, cash and clothes
Fast as hoes, then get ghosts like Casper though
Smash 'em though, they don't know what hit 'em
Childish Gambino, show a nigga that you with him say "ayo"I do not talk, I am just a rapper
I am so different, being me is like the lottery
I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep
Niggas makin pottery, but I broke the mold
Now my shit has got them dancing like I channel Oakenfold
Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
And these hoes are actin' different cause I'm Rich comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck
You know I gotta give a fuck
My face is broken out
My shirt is hand-me-down
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shit and lay me out
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny how I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new clothes were the potion
Cause I never felt that good in my own skin
It's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool
Cause I wear these tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt
Yeah, I'm self conscious
Go ahead - laugh it up
Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up
They told my ass to blacken up
What the fuck are you?
You don't even say shit
Quit writing gay shit
Now they see me and have to squint like asians
Cause I'm on fire and everything I touch blazes
Giving you the realness
Kid I got a lot of it
Listen to my mixtapes, tell me if they contradict
Don't fuck with these niggas cause this swag is abstinent
I don't have time to sleep
I don't have time to eat
These niggas got time to do
Everything but be unique
I gotta do me like I'm jerkin' in the mirror
I am just a rapper
Can't make it clearer
Yes I'm in the building
No I own the company
Your girlfriend's sister--you cannot fuck with me
Childish Gambino
We are all children
I am just a murderer
We have just killed themGirl I make you come fast, I mean come right over
Yes a nigga so street, call a nigga Grover
Hit it like I'm supposed to, love it when you're smiling
Except when you're not smiling giving my dick oral hygene
Girlfriend you know me, I'm all about my benjamins
But you stay sweet like an ever-lasting entenmann
Girfriend center them geniuses, that's me
Talking bout in and out with a girl named Ashley
Jessica, Tamika, Alison, Stacy
Why does every girl in the world wanna date me?
Specially right now man, specially when I'm busy
Tell me that they love me, then they try to kiss me
Baby don't you see me? Knee-deep in that dope game
Meaning that I'm dope mane, hotter than that propane
Hotter than that propane, yes I said it twice dude
Always on the move I love the Journey like a white dude
Yes I know I'm quite rude, arrogant as Alva
But I have the decency to back all of my words up
So let's not pretend like every girl don't wanna be ya
You can be my Ms. Obama minus Sasha and Maliya ugh!
You make me feel, feel so shiny and new
Like I'll never be blue again
And the magic moment feels so right
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you oooh!
Why you always mad at me, I was gon come right back
Fucking with them fly girls, that was only chit chat
It's part of my job, yes I'm young and charming
And I smell like money so these girls are all up on me
Let's have bygones be bygones, they don't know what they're doing like a cylon
Trying to get my python, you can check my iPhone
Rolodex Gchat
When you come over all I ask is "Where my V at?"
Like I work at ABC, look at me rambling
You can be a pimp, these girls making money but they'll never make sense
Half of yall crazy, the other half trying to get their paper having babies
Naw I ain't down with that "Hooohh!" like a thundercat
Try to poke holes in the base where I keep soldiers at
Sneaky like a Cheshire cat, sneaky like a baby sneaker
One of these girls got my number I ain't trying to meet her
Yes you are fine Anita, but I ain't trying to be the
Father of five you need to find a new guy or either
Step it up 2, but you are not Cassie
Cause you have full head, I mean you're smart nasty
Ooohhh girl Childish Gambino you will get in with a wristband he know
People took an hour just to stand outside in line
I knew that you would do it, and I reckon you lookin' fine
These bitches better be mine, I'm horny all the time
Gambino be the one who put a hump up in your spine
Drink a little wine, do a little dance
Now im goin' home, now im in your pants
Forget that, I ain't take the condom off
New swag ever since im bustin' off
I get head like a bottle of Tylenol
You like girls when you know you can buy them all
A fireball, I'm hot as fuck, I bust a nut with tons of sluts
Go ahead shake your thing baby, look hot
Why the girls doin' me? Ho why not?
I mean why not?
Tell her, some bullshit on my whip im 'bout to take it back

They ain't in our league, so they can't hang with em'
Strip club, and the squad came with em'
Two girls coming home like they fresh outta prison
Say words if you get it
We only give a damn if a check came with it
Two blunts and that old dude who lives it
I got bitches in the pen who I don't even visit
You came in the carpet
You get a lot of pussy when they make you a star
A girl in LA and I don't know her name
But she get pissed off when she talking insane
Paper man people guns with the thang'
I was a little broke but it started to change
Drop a couple songs, and that's all of the bang
Cause I ridin' on the track like I'm part of a train
My girl southside when I hit the booth
I drink roc' roc' straight fuck the juice
A big bro throw bread like fuck the loot
I'm back bitch, I'm back Prince
I'm back shit, my home boy pissed off
I put my hands on that ass, cause that shit soft
Two guns it'll burn off
When you stunt like Stevie, it'll turn offYou can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feel like summer
I feel like summer
She feel like summer
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feel like summer
I feel like summer
She feel like summer
I feel like summer
Moving fast around the sun, away we go
Rolling fast, not a chance for me to slow down 
Slow down
Moving fast just spreading all our seeds around
Parents tryna tell their children please slow down
Slow down
Oh, I know you're still the same
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
Oh, I hope we change
I really thought this world could change
But it seems like the same
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feel like summer
I feel like summer
She feel like summer
Every day we learning something once unknown
You can feel it coming, it's about to go down
Go down
Higher, higher, higher is the way to go
Moving fast still with not a chance to come down
Come down
Oh, I know you-you're still the same
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
Oh, I hope we change
I really thought this world could change
But it seems like the sameStarlight
Where did you go?
I've been running around the world
Gotta let you know
I got the empire state now I'm working on the next part
Trying to build an empire, I'm wishing on the Death Star
I murdered the dish, I eloped with the spoon
Tri-coastal and the third coast is the moon
When it hits your eye like a get in your eye thing
And we do the I like you like like you like like thing
I can't promise I won't be dressed like a viking
When I do the whole picking you up on my bike thing
Another white rapper's CD in my spokes
I would swear ya'll converted to rap for the jokes
I spit black smoke, I'm the hip hop pope
They make anti-me PSA's cuz I'm dope
And when it's not clear you can cope, the worlds a negative iPod
You just hear 'nope'
Nights on the pavement, you just stop breathin'
On some Liz Lemon movin' back to Cleveland
Street lights people, up and down the boulevard
Don't stop believin in your journey, and I know it's hard
They call me Violet Beauregard, cuz I just blow up, no regard
All I really need is a bar to belly up to
A balcony, a star crossed lover to yell up to
So what are you up to? This weekend I'm free
Till then I'll just shine and let you find me
I shine like the sun
My mouth is a gun, pop off and they run, two things like a pun
This is not just for fun and I cut with my tongue
My mouth's a Swiss army, take over your country
I run like a humvee, I don't need gas-o-line
I run on these rappers so skip the stromboli
I make these niggas say 'Great' like Tony
So how the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me?
How the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me
When you all on the tip of my dick like Moby
The wait is over, no baking soda
I saw them dudes move bricks and boulders
I saw them dudes move flats and corners
And they moved that sugar like Russell Stover
I got that green like a four leaf clover
Get rich or die tryin' like my name two quarters
Dope boys they get me, we got the same hustle till the tank on empty
And if you dope boy, better watch the Wire
And get the shit straight, turn back, retire
Cuz one in a mil turn snow to fire
You either move weight, play ball or neither
Because I'm neither, the hood Macgyver
The boy blew up like he knew Al Quaeda

I turn ‘em like Tina, I don’t tote ninas
But a nigga walked up and get served like subpoenas
And I ain’t broke neitha, I got a in-between
So when I say about a million what I mean is bitch fiend
I gotta keep grinding, my name Tony Hawk
‘Cause I grind with my boys sometimes at the park
A heavy-ass kid, easy on the cake
Until I got to New York and I started losin’ weight
And when I say “weight,” I do mean "weight”
Now I'm thin like the line between love and hate
Cause I used to go skate
Nigga I’m paid, this kid don’t play like a high-top fade
I don’t get laid, I’m back at the studio
The closest girls get is watchin’ old Derrick videos
Girls don’t get it, say I work too much
Pass boo the cell phone and say, "Girl, be in touch"
But we won’t be in touch, I know that for sure
You ain’t in love with me, you like my décor
Christian Dior, pastel and Jack
If it’s in hot pink then it’s on my back
I’m young and I’m black and the world is my oyster
Watchin’ Top Chef on my European sofa
These niggas so fake like an old toupee
So clear call this shit Blu-Ray
Ooh, aah, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Ooh, aah, oh yeah

Fallin' out, ooh, down
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Oh, fallin' down, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Take me to a hospital, call me Ebola
And a nigga flow sweet, so I spit Coca Cola
And my boys sold boulders, but I gotta do it my way
We grindin' the same, but we usin' different pathways
Gotta make ends meet, a means to an end
And I hate seein’ niggas usin’ “grind,” for pretend
Cause this ain’t pretend, and I ain’t pretendin’
We eatin’ out late like I hang with the gremlins
Call David Geffen, we about to switch places
The game is a hold, got a pocket full of aces
Boy, I’m a phenom, I can’t be stopped
Had my RA pager on my first day at 30 Rock
Headed for big things like I’m runnin’ Salma Hayek
Four Seasons plus no more work at the Hyatt
I’m fly and I’m high like a pilot
But you can’t see me like an eyelid, vibin’, uh
Ooh, aah, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Ooh, aah, oh yeah

My shoes bright blue, so you watch my step
My hoody hot pink with the hat to match
So you ain't gotta know where my paper at
Pop tags cause I'm filthy, apes can bathe me
My home is the dirty but I shine like crazy
My hat tag up and it hang off slightly
My game 8-bit so you niggas can bite me
Nike like me cause my life is great
I'm married to the game, we should consummate
Brand new hoodies the color of light sabers
My name ain't Luke, but that dude date Leias
With fly ass sneakers
Bump them speakers
Pump this groove 'til your ear start bleedin'
White girls shake it 'til the black dudes notice
Black girls shake it so you can regain focus
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Let's get one thing straight, I'm no average rapper
Born in SoCal, then I hit Atlanta
Then to New York, I'm an army brat
And I learn new things all across the map
In Cali, I was small taught need to be strong
And Atlanta had the hawk so I learned how to ball
New York had Starks on the New York Knicks
So when they came around I had my first round pick
And now I'm so sick that they call me Ebola
Sick girls all on my pole like totem
Life is a gamble, your boy done told 'em
Play your cards right like it's Texas hold 'em
Bounce dem shoulders, go ahead Bankhead
I can do it better even though I'm Stone Mountain
Georgia's on my mind, but I live in New York
So I got a Southern drawl and I limp when I walk
They used to say a nigga lame when I started to rap
Now them fake fuck niggas askin' me for a track
Pokin' me on Facebook tryna be my friend
Nigga, you get your face took you ask me one more 'gain
I'm a G that's why call the shit Gmail man
This is my space nigga, you can't make top ten
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it out
Swag it out, swag it outI'm a diamond in the rough, everybody knows the score
Bambino on top and them haters claymore
"But the people want more!" And I'ma give it to 'em
I was born a winner, all I had to do was show 'em
My hoodie canary yellow but I'm bright on my own
Most haters out there take naps like combs
I never sleep, I'm always on my grind
I never eat, unless a rapper spit a rhyme
Sick girls jockin', haters keep hatin'
They pissed off cause I'm more Eli than Peyton
Cause I'm the underdog, which means I'm under, dog
I'm not a nigga who moves snow like Santa Claus
I'm just a nigga with watermelons instead of balls
Cause I work from the bottom to the top
I used to be lost like Locke
Haters got a shook core like Pac, get it?
Said the proof is in the pudding
The secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss
Said the proof is in the pudding
The secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss
I'm a winner 
I'm a winner 
I'm a winner 
I'm a winner 
I'm a winner 
I'm a winner 
I'm a winner 
I'm a winner 
He work hard for the money, but it ain't about cash 
Life's a schoolyard, I ain't gettin' picked last

Listen, son, I'mma show them how it's done
When my swagger weighs a ton
Stickin' straws inside of girls, you can call me the Capri Sun
I make the girls drip, so I guess I eat Gushers
Screaming out yeah like I'm eating out Usher
In your dad's bedroom where I fuck you
Knockin' on the door, so you're screaming out "nothing"
But they all know it's something
You didn't think I'd tear the pussy up, did you pumpkin?
But better and better like Benjamin Button
I hang out with Chester Cheeto
Cooler than the ranch on your Dorito
Hotter than the peppers in your burrito
Getting cheddar and cream, if you know what I mean
Yeah, I know what you mean, homegirl mistaken
She think Gambino won't bring home bacon
Or bring home Swiss cheese, my dough got holes
Cause all these hoes want shoes and nice clothes
They want the Macy's, the Neiman Marcus
The Fendi purses, the Gucci parkas

They see Gambino and they act retarded
Fat people do fat things

Before you even know how long this song lasts
You'll be reelin' and feelin' so flabbergasted
Like a fast pass that you can't catch, I'll leave you blasted
Lambasted, like I doused you in acid
I could be takin' some comedy and I'm makin' that tradic
Like I spin, cause I hocus, I focus, I'm flippin' it back and now it's magic
And the beat go from cool, like plan is to janet, to dammit!
Cuties cute in to inspect my go-go gadget
Why? Cause I spit in split time. It's a sign of a double wear prada I'm reachin'
I'm teachin' 'em for a while that you can't deny I'm alive
So existential, my rhymes are quinessential
I'm an educated black and that's a fact. I'm presidential
One riff, and I'm siftin' through n*ggas lies
Got a gift to keep my eyes on the prize, you best move to the side
Cause I'm goin' for the gold, I'm a stone soldier
Gambino told you Jokers that I'm so, so, so foc- I'm so FO-cusssssssed
I'm all grown up, but I'm still Childish
It's crazy to think that all them days is behind us
I remember when niggas tried to stop us
Now them same niggas on my dick and try for profit
This is what I asked for. It comes with the territory
This isn't a cry for help, ain't no pinnochio story
I'm in it just for the glory - I'm in this to win it, babe
Sorry that I came home lateWe do it
We do it
We do it
Yeah, yeah
Kill ‘em
That’s what I hear when I get a hot feel
In my nostrils
In my forehead
As I code red
You’d be more dead
Than a horse head
In a four bedroom apartment
Bloggers that’ll start shit
You wanna criticize me
Just so you can drink green tea
With Lykke Li at a speakeasy?
Wearin’ some American Apparel
While you’re starin’ at a Tim and Eric DVD, uh
Can’t get enough
Crime Mob Shit, knuck if you buck
Celibate girls do stuff in the butt
Get it out with a Q-tip or some Müeslix
I’m a eunuch just ‘cause I can’t give a fuck
Kiss her on the neck while she’s buttonin’ up
Uh and my pants down
It’s funny how when I put Camp out
They gotta camp out
Better than half of all rap that you have on your laptop
At your dad’s house, hands down
Fake niggas say “you the man now”
Got a DJ like Roseanne’s house
Sam go hard like a handjob, nigga
Yeah, Childish don’t go hard, what

You're fucking with ambition
Casino money like Navajo
Their money says, Geronimo
My money comes in lotto dough
Be me on the other tit
Call me Mr. Masturbate
Tighter than your jerking grip

The game is afoot, the mystery's at hand
We like to pilfer podiums, in other words we take a stand
We make a plan, attack that jam like it was Afghanistan
We like to ride our bikes, mother fuck a mystery van
Stop and listen be shoplifting 'pocalyptic Stephen King
I take a stand, fuck the man
Now will you please pull that string
I need your case and a dime
But we also take Fruit Roll-Ups
Takin' a bite out of crime, so all criminals better hold up
I be riding forever
Like a vampire on a bus
Like a roller-coaster tester
I be riding till I bust
I got my magnifying glass
My bike matches my cup
Watch my seekers eat pedal
You can dine on my dust
Whatever it is we can handle
But we really don't do murder
Fuck up suspects, gather clues
Then we break for a cheeseburger
No shit Sherlock, mad like Murdock
If there's a mystery going on
Be in it like Robin Williams chilled in Good Morning, Vietnam
Nanu, nanu, nanu, nanu
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be, nigga this who I am
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be and I hope that you understand
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
This comedy movie was not fun to make
At all
So when you're sitting in your living room and you're yucking it up
Or in the theater
Or, you know, and you're saying oh with your little friends
Oh this is so funny
It's not funny
We started making this five years ago and we're still trying to get shit right
I'm going to get some Cheez-Its from KraftyIs it really that bad that my clothes is tight?
That I hydrate babes like Pedialyte
That I stay rock hard like a meteorite
Thought your homeboy here was an idiot right?
Well, ya thought wrong, I got flavor
I rock shows with the blue lightsaber
I hit dimes but also date eighters
I make moves, blow up like Al-Qaeda
I'm in kicks that you can't buy yet
Ya kicks okay like your name Wyatt
Care Bear Clockers, pink highlighters
Haters wanna snatch my heat like firefighters
Boys out there think they just like me

I'm the rapper makin' noise when there's shadow in your area
I’m like a damager cause I’m a little loquacious
I do it for the hotties with the bodies bodacious
I'm high pitched, might flip if ya diss my node
Think Chris ain't the shit, you can kiss my chode
Weak ass sales, not too early to boast
Seriously bro, hand over the security code
Because my rhymes so fresh, greengrocers' gotta spray 'em
Fired all my lawyers cause I didn't wanna pay 'em
From the PM to the AM I'll slay 'em with the sawed-off
Make a little money and I'll smoke the marijuana
MC without Glover is Murtaugh without Riggs
Jam and peanut butter with the crust cut off for kids
One smokes Kinds, the other smokes Mids
Let's mix it up a little like the DJ did
Bacardi and Coke, black and white cookie
Smokin' in the alley cause you know we're playin' hooky
We're up to no good, please don't tell our mamas
Don't mock us  'cause we got this for Obama
Ooh, bum bumbumbum bum bumbumbum
Sicker than Old Yeller, money like bank tellers
The chicks that I'm with are thicker than Nutella
Y'all need to switch quick and get with a sick fella
Cause I'm bout to go Rihanna like I'm an Umbrella
Come over to my place, we can cut like shears
And make some mistakes like Jamie Lynn Spears
I'm nasty? No. Forward? Yes
I'm hip to the game, you're a rook like chess
My money so long that they call it John Silver's
Your money so light that it fluff like pillows
Boutique killers, you can see
They close up shop when the clerks see me
I'm not Kanye, but my collar's popped
Cause the bro's like soda, I shit you not
This shit's bright orange, Fanta shade
You got the yellow face, that's my lemonade
I'ma try to stay tight like girls that fuck hard
Stay in the Bay with green like Brett Farve

Try to get the girls, call the guy go getter
Tight jeans and Converse sneakers 
No cheddar, go home in a rogue letter
It's a college center, so my financial aid's better
You better dead her, yo that girl's going crazy
She got a twinkle in her eye like she want to have a baby
Maybe I should call her up on a Saturday
Take her to a dinner and a movie, Braves game
Maybe we can call her up again
You looking good girl, you should bring your friends
And I don't really talk shit, I'm a douche and a bad rapper

Most of y'all insufferable, soundin' like a board scratch

Lyrically a metaphor, Atlanta's only troubadour
Face it; only seen by a few like a unicorn
I'ma try to get my swagger right, like I'm Dolemite
Spread it all around to the kids like it's Vegemite
Get the proper etiquette, bitch you from Connecticut!
I'ma try to modify the subject like a predicate

INES and Foxy Show
Shia, you suck bad!
As the world's turning, feel like I'm a worse person
My tongue's hurting, from all of its work cursing
And I'm not certain, I think my father's LeVar Burton
Till I'm walking in circles and I'm talking in third person
In the eighth grade I got high off paper mache
I put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day
Because ain't nothing changed, I'm still known as a rude student
That'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shooting
I can prove it, I'm too cool as a matter of fact
I been writing these verses while I'm having a heart attack
I'm in your bedroom cranking on out and staring black
Stereo blaring, Gwen Steffani can holla back
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin
At a Klan rally wondering why they won't let me in
Shia, I'm coming straight for ya, I hope you know that I'm on ya
D to the O's got a flow like menstrual cycles
Change my face every year like Michael... Jackson
Cause I'm packing heat
I got the fucking beat and a fucking lead
Dripping on you motherfuckers all the time
I bust guts like I bust a rhyme
I bust nuts like I'm Busta Rhymes
And I ain't even gotta do it, I ain't have the time
On Community
What you do to me?
Fly girls wanna get inside my booty
Or is it the other way around
Cause I'm skating on a skateboard, driving downtown
At Peachtree, Atlanta, Stone Mountain till I die
E-40 got nothing on this
Horny motherfucker from the Stone Mountain Georgia
Got something for ya
Yeah that freestyle was torture
I'm done!I do not talk, I am just a rapper
I am so different, being me is like the lottery
I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep
Niggas makin pottery, but I broke the mold
Now my shit has got them dancing like a baby Oakenfold
Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
And these hoes are actin' different cause I'm Rich comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck
You know I gotta give a fuck
You know I gotta give a fuck
My face is broken out
My shirt is hand-me-down
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shirt and lay me out
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny how I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new clothes were the potion
Cause I never felt that good in my own skin
It's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool
Cause I wear these tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt
Yeah, I'm self conscious
Go ahead, laugh it up
Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up
They told my ass to blacken up
What the fuck are you?
You don't even say shit
Quit writing gay shit
Now they see me, have to squint like Asians
Cause I'm too bright like an old night light
When I do not talk, I am being polite
Rap all night
Act all day
Mama so scared 'imma waste away
I don't have time to sleep
I don't have time to eat
These niggas got time to do
Everything but be unique
I gotta do me like I'm jerkin' to a mirror
I am just a rapper
Can't make it clearer
To every kid in a world full of pain
Please give a listen to this song and my name
Childish Gambino
We are all children

I'm in NYC or in ATL
And my wallet stay fat like Kenan plus Kel
Nigga what's that smell, cause my shit don't stink
Cause my shirt bright blue and my shoes hot pink

I'm like "sorry boo, I gotta come up inside"
"And if you wanna feel that  kick in your thighs"Lyrics from Guava Island:
Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow
But one thing's for certain, baby

The Class is Mamalia, 'cos boobies, we gotta
Order is Primate, Family Hominidae
The genus is Homo, but you know you're into me
Because I am in the species known as Sapien
Dogs used to eat me, but now they bring the paper in
It's going to take a lot to get me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa

They say black don't crack, except for Whitney
My shit don't crack, I fall off like Britney
To put it simply, I lose my balance
Cause I got a pink drink and it makes me tipsy

Pulled the covers over my head and went straight back to bed
Cause even my good days are generally bad
At my happiest, I'm just slightly less sad
And I get mad if you're glad to be alive
Cause I had a chance at a happy life
Good mom, good dad
Seriously trust me, you wouldn't wanna be me
The best days of my life involve leftovers and TV
I got almost no friends and I don't know how to handle this
Even the friends I do got are all moving to Los Angeles
Even I'm tired of my whining
Even I don't want no more of me
I whine more than a 3-year old multiplied by Morrisey
Every time I meet someone who wants to be my friend
The first thought that I have is, "Yo what the fuck is wrong with them?"
I go through life with my fists up
But trust me my fists are all
Full of handfuls of Wellbutrin and Risperdal
I'm depressed y'all
Someone please help me

Well, I got two Mounds but no Almond Joy
And all these fools wanna taste my cream
Infatuation thick like a slab of good brie
Infatuation real all they think of is me
Yes all these fucking Charlies got a lactose disease
But they not intolerant, they daydream more than moderate
It's just not a meal until you sprinkle Parmesan on it
It's just not a get until you give all you got on it
It's just not a cock until you pumpin' all of your heart in it
Look at him staring at my lips
Ain't they thicker than a pair of African hips
I thought we was friends, but he think we gon' kiss
Here he comes leaning in, he swing, he miss
How's it feel to taste a mouthful of air yes
How's it feel to kiss me knowing I am not there
Boy I need a censor, boy you need a mentor
These boys need to be lead like they're two pencils
Yes I'm a black nerd, it's that simply
Call me poindexter or the black Ed Grimly
Girl attitude stay stank like kimchi
But she ain't Korean and her boy ain't friendly
Turn your girls that are friends to fuck buddies
Keep 'em on the wire, that's why I cuddy
And every girl that I'm friends with wants to fuck
That's why she waits till I'm drunk, then she runs amok
Guess boy my name's an aphrodisiac
Yes boy at the hotel's where I leave 'em at
I am Animaniac cause I'm so wacko
Better warn a brother when you see a chick act ho
And even if she's so Angel that she's on Bones

The DEEP WEB TOUR started
Oakland was hard because we didn’t play.  which was weird.  people were mad.  but then someone got married, rather engaged, outside so people got happy again and forgave.  it was the computer’s fault tho
We talked about getting a tour pet.  stefan is unofficially the tour pet
It’s very cool to see people use the DEEP WEB app. people draw dicks and swastikas
In santa barbara, we got to play outside.  i had a burrito for breakfast that morning. it was fun cause fam and i wore backpacks to blend in to the crowd on campus to get there.  someone said “that nigga think he childish gambino”. i did think that
When we get to stop at a hotel,  we call down and tell the concierge to check on our children at 9pm because “we’re going out to a cocktail party and they should be in bed by that time”. and when they go up there, steve and swank  are up there. the reaction is always enjoyable.  we’re trying to find an older white couple to come downstairs and tell the concierge for us, to really sell it. but we haven’t found someone willing to yet
“you’re gonna miss every moment of this…of everything.”
Sometimes i feel like i’m already gone/ahead and i’m just vividly remembering everything that’s happening in the moment. fur real. sometimes everything feels too familiar to be just happening for the first time. the shows feel like that sometimes. you can’t understand something totally and enjoy it at the same time, i think. but it’s fun to not know all of it.  everybody wants some magic.  something they can’t quite figure out
Someone put girl scout cookies in the freezer. hot damn

Shout out to black nerds, shout out to white ones
Shout out to Asians, keep playin’ Street Fighter
Shout out to nerd chicks in glasses, sweeter than cinnamon
Me and Sick Boi are synonyms
People hear my voice and say, “What happened to Eminem?!
This shit is absurd! He’s saying the n-word!”
Naw, it’s just Bam-B. The nigga that’s crazy for giving shit free
And fuck iTunes, I’m doin’ it OG
And girls love my dick like a song that’s on Glee
Nigga, call me Elroy - because I’m so high
That you cannot measure, I’m losing cabin pressure
Got drive like a brand new Volvo
I’m so official, I’m the Foot Locker logo, niggaHow's it going Sesame Street?
How great is this?
The greatest
Sometimes you got a problem, the kind you can't erase
Sometimes it jumps up and slaps you in the face
Don't run around in circles, don't scream and shout
Just put your heads together and figure it out
Figure it out, baby figure it out
Figure it out, baby figure it out
Don't run around in circles, don't scream and don't shout
Just put your heads together and figure it out
Sometimes the problem's easy, you solve it right away
Sometimes the problem's tricky, you work it all day
But either way you think it through, that's what it's all about
You put your heads together and figure it out
 x2I used to play the fool all by myself
You used to make me feel real good
I used to eat my food all by myself
I used to do the dishes too
I used to break your heart all by myself
I used to be the only one around...
Be yourself, there's no understanding
Something that happened that night
Be yourself, there's no understanding at all
There is no understanding, noooo
Be yourself, there's no understanding
Something that happened that night
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
There is no understanding
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
No understanding what happened
That night baby
Be yourself, there's no understanding
Oh
There is no me and you
Me and youPlease text me, text me, and emoji me
Text me, just want emoji, just so I can see what you thinking
I don't know what you thinking
I texted you like five hours ago and I don't know what you thinking
Do you hate me? Do you love me? Do you think I'm stupid?
Are you saying we should be together; we should move in together?
Or should you say you have my babies?
And be my baby mama, I fell in love with you to be my baby mama
From a like a day and a half
I needed you when I asked
I'm grabbing you after class
We dancing together, we used to go out like every single Friday
Kissing you in your mouth, we make out in the hallway
I'm so in love with you
I think about you every day I'm so in love with you
Ain't no one above you
Ain't nobody telling me I'm acting like I'm feeling
When I'm freestlying out my mouth, and I don't know what to say
Every time I see your face, I don't know what to say
A lot of girls in the audience think I'm talking about Jhene
I don't think about 
Get it together my head, I'm doing what I'm doing
Screwing up from the top, man I'd like to make you mine
But, you're so far away
So far away
No no
And I'd wish you'd come back, come back, come back 
I be looking with a flashlight
Especially if cute with her ass right
I met her at the Drexel, spread it like a pretzel
You know Steve is the best though
Move it like I normally do
My crew, we so sick like we all had the Flu
That's swine, you know I be taking my time
I love a young lady and she  too fine
With a hat to the front that's cool, or glasses
You know me, I skip classes
But I'm still high, like high school
Still so fly, like flight school
I'm a young jet, plus a young vet
A nigga young  he go New York Nets
Royalty forever
Every time I see you girl, you're so far away
Bring it down for a second
Just bring it down a second
Bring it down for a second
Bring it down for a second
Talk about the movies that we hate
I used to kiss you and be like 'Pete's sake'
For Pete's sake, I got that money in my wallet like a fucking Philly cheese steak
I got a million and a half
They used to tell me I wouldn't get a million and a half
But you knew me back when I ain't have enough to ride the subway
Now you call me all day saying like 'why you saying that them girls or them girls'
I though we supposed to get married when we both turned thirty
And when you said that, that shit really kinda hurt me
Because, I made that promise. I broke that promise
I'm tryna get back, but that's behind us
But now I wanna see exactly where you going, or where you coming
Your boyfriend telling you that you be jamming
You're so far away
If you hold my hand, we can be together forever
But you don't wanna say that no more
You just wanna say I'm on tour
So now I'm sitting here on the floor
Because you're so far away
Yo, ayo but fuck that, you told me not to call you all the time
And now you mad I'm your mind and I'm on your mouth motherfucker, my god
Gonna kick that shit, pop that pop
Gonna get down till that drop
 bitch
You gonna talk that? Talk that? Talk that shit behind my back?
Told me that I'm not that but I'm on that, and I rock shit
But they know me here, walking around with your hands in the air
So. Far. Away. 
I'm so far awayWoke up this mornin' from a nightmare
Four in the mornin' with a fear in my eyes
Looked to my left and you were right there
I started cryin' 'cause it made me realize
No one is here, we are alone, babe
We are alone with our love
No one's out there, we are alone, babe
We are alone with our love
When the world ends
I think I wanna die with you, no, no-no-no 
When the world ends
I think I wanna die with you, no, no-no-no 
When the world ends
I think I wanna die with you, no, no-no-no 
When the world ends
I think I wanna die with you, no, no-no-no 
When the world ends 
I think I wanna die with you, no, no-no-no “Where's the ground? Where’s the earth? Where's mom?”
She left
And now we're headed somewhere. Moment to moment. But we don’t know where and we can’t stop living. The Internet, our new earth, moves forward only leaving behind a curated record
Because the Internet was made to be the soundtrack to this new coding. The reworking of our humanity. Trying to find  again after the big bang. Every soul looking for each other like every drop of water looks for the Ocean
The rules of the Internet are the rules of our new universal language like the Bible, like the Constitution, we make rules to break later and be better. Pushing forward until we are all just a bodiless conscious, buzzing through the air trading information, conversing, testing ideas without fear or violence. Free from limit. This is the moment we decide if we want to be the kid pouring salt on a worker’s head at the sit in, or the kids sitting calmly in the face of what everyone else identifies as futility
… Or we can be the kid sitting back, just trying to eat. Ignoring what’s happening in front of them. Not having an opinion until the acceptable choice is handed to you by people you don’t know
We have reached a moment where there is no “real” because we don’t care anymore we can curate what’s real every day our timeline or feed. The boundary of what’s real and what we want to be real is as volatile as the worth of our bitcoin or human heartbeat
This is an important moment
But beware that we are all making it up as we go. Together
Our human collective unconscious
Our deep web

Cool like a summertime pool in the winter
A nigga on fire, what he have for dinner

Or else I'm gonna end up inside a casket
Who the fuck's you? They call me Sick Boi
Got the Andre fever, get like Big Boi
If you try to get the kryptonite on me
You're gonna have to D-I-E
The nigga is amazing

If you don't believe me you can suck on my bongo
I used to drive a hondo now I'm on the subway
Now my pocket's thick like that dude from Subway
You can have a hyundai, better yet a milli
I'm not Lil Weezy but my pocket size silly
My wrist not chilly, I only sport Clockers
Got the purple hoody and the purple Gobstoppers
My mama used to tell me I was lost like Chaka
Now I got the yellow truck like my name Tonka
My girlfriend ass stay fit like J-Lo
Girl and my money stay thick like Play Doh
Got to philosophize my mind like Plato

I wanna be the play date, but if you have one
You can call me, on my cell phone
I don't believe it, I don't gotta see it
And if you don't see nothing you can sync up my penis
Women are from Venus, men are from Mars
And I'm walking down the street, while you drivin in cars
Cause I want everybody to see my new kicks
My hat broke off and my hoodie so sick

Listen up, listen Glov, kids and up, give us love
Sick cause ya, click a buzz, in the light, yeah bruv
Whether in cinemas or in the club spittin' fast
In my element like -- in a skinhead bar
Riz is not the type of spitter, to write a bit of shit about the bitches, ice and glitter
I find it limiting, I'd rather print the bigger picture
Them bars are boring like they only pouring pints of bitter
Yes, I'm an actor but I'm realer than most
Won battles and had the best choke, put fear in they throats
Songs banned cause the lines are so bold
I drop science and flow, so the album's called Microscope
And it's rougher than the road to Guantanamo
Switch like bricks on the latch that go from alcohol to powder nose
Sniff up her lips, on the prowl for coke, but the dealer was shifty, sold him a load of panadol
Rappers so fashion school, look like Timmy Mallet do
Mallet you, push your pineapple till you Agadoo
Battle you, serve you red rub, why? 
Cause you be layin' backwards as Malibu
Shit's ruthless like Trishner's abusers
Manners are ill -- banks are too rich
Troops dig deep in the Middle East, bruisin' for crude, lootin' black gold for blue chips
But are you, as thin as a toothpick? Through two bricks and a few ticks, gets a few years
We werent blinded by knobs like the -- resign, but hoes a bonus when the dude quits
I got views, make political music, money and gun rappers are sayin' what Fox News is
Get money and buy shit, anybody who tries it should die
Why are rappers so right-wing?
Food for thought, do you avoid diet?
I'm on the Wu-Tang tour so chew on my four tyres
People confuse me for Rooney, no lie
Think I'm the star from 3, but I mean 4 lions
Uh, girls text me after shows, I wanna call 'em all
Got some goons to hold my money, must be ballin' hard
Had a tour, I broke my foot, I had to brawl it off
"I ain't heard nothin' yet, man, Gambino must've fallen off."
Nah, never that, dawg, run it back
Back to chillin' on Memorial and Harrison
Mama, no more Arizona Jeans, that shit's embarrasin', I got a Truffaut jacket and me and my brother sharin' it
Anythin' they hand us, minivans and bandannas
That Wickes voucher stuntin', I think 'bout my cousin
Every time I spit an ill verse, like that time we talked about which Power Ranger that we'd kill first, that shit was so funny man, that shit was no money
Pyjamas and oatmeal, way you livin' is so real
Need a Nobel prize, for them coke deals, I thought co-tell, right?
Them boys you been fuckin' with, now they busy beefin' cause they see you on some other shit? Not to mention the government
I ain't trynna see you on the first 48
Wonder if God hears when an atheist prays
I don't know what to say, man that better change quick
Women love to spit, love women who swallow you
Makin' me, I won't woo when they mention your album
I don't know what I should tell them: That we royalty? That they spoil me?
Pretty girls on the grass with some champagne, all I do is win and make Azealia's last name
Is -- gonna go and make his own lane? Man, I hope so, shit is so cut throat
Brought a knife to a gun show, brought a gun to a bear fight
Grizzly bear screams in my hair when I say "night."
Cause I don't wanna make moves that they all regret, I just wanna make something that they all respect
Go on, let 'em know wooTell me what the faith is, flow is on a wait list
Someone keep that shit shut, all white, no cut
I fucked up but I still came and I still reign like thunder
Everything's been done some, screamin' like we love them
But I still get what I deserve
You live, you learn, you wait your turn and you crush 'em
Fall back, all that, freshmen you're welcome
Still flip with these young hoes, still stunt with these fly clothes
Still rep for that East side where they bang toys like Tyco
I'm busy one percentin', I'm rapper Armageddon
Introducin' all that bullshit all these other niggas spittin'
Yo it's Childish, I'm wild, bitch, all white coke like scientist
Stupid busy, fuckin' with your main like a lioness
Nigga scrunch your face up, all we get it queso
All we watch is cartoons, hatin' man, that's all you
Fuckboy, that's all you, say shit when I saw you
Say shit on that online but that's fake beef like dog food
Panic room blue, too soon to be into it
These Silver Lake niggas know hood like a clitoris
Bang, bang, bang, bang, shots fired, A-Town, Empire
What you think we all about? Watchin' bitches trippin' outWell, it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I want to marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby
I think I wanna marry you
Well I know at little chapel by the boulevard that we can go
No one will know oh oh oh
Come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed, got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on, girl
Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go
If you're ready, like I'm ready
Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I want to marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby
I think I wanna marry you
I'll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like oh
So what you want to do?
Let's just run girlSomeone gave you all my love, baby
All my love
All my love
Remember back when we had just met
I was living life on reasons that i could not get
You probably only talked to me cause I was someone new
But you were interested cause it was someone to get you
I think I notice that I could never forget you
I want you to be happy, a break I'mma let you
And I would wait for ya, perfect tale, Hachi
I know you will be back, honest, no dude that can match me
We are perfect, you bring me up, you can't tell me
You can't see us living a life like Carl Fredricksen and Ellie
By all means if you don't get what that means
I am more then a dude who wants to be up in your jeans
But I love that shit, we do it big
Shit I'mma dog for you, its what I dig
But at the moment if this is not what you need
Let me tell you that our love is what people dream of
And of course I love you more then ever
I think you're the reason I feel I'm gettin better
We can fuck till we come to conclusions, you're gettin wetter
I think without you who will watch the sequel of The Purge
Im on the verge of saying that I'm all yours its my word
I do not really know how to get it through to you, you're beautiful
Its crazy when we lay it down all the things I do to you
And I meant that from the bottom of my heart
I think we can do this, why would we need to restart
All for you, I would do it all for you
When you feeling sad who is the dude that be coming through
And I feel that too long, I've been feeling too strong
To let emotions go from you
That's really how I feel wit you
The things we can do
The talks we have and how we're so true
Thats how it is, lets make our own movie
We can be ourselves, honestly you're a real beautyGive me, um
Give me something on like
Give me something on this tempo, on
This time, that's like
Give me something on the bass that's like
Do-do-do, do, do-do-do-doo, do
Do-do-do-doo, do
Give me something on the organ that's like
Doo-doooo
Yeah, there we go
Watch me, watch me, baby
I know, it's hard
Drop me, drop me, baby
I know, I can see the stars
The stars I love, we get old
Wanna believe in this lie, I see
Can you tell me, what's on your mind?
'Cause your love is so hard to find
People used to count me out
People want to get flyin' out like a stamp
People used to count me out
People used to talk that shit when I was at Camp
People used to count me out
People used to tell me all that bullshit's real tho
People used to count me out
'Cause music ain't shit, that's why I changed the deal
Man, I gotta do my own thing
I gotta do my own thing, gotta learn to pick it, man
I've got to pick a wedding ring
But I don't really understand if they want to do the same
Have to be, had to go
Had to move from Glassnote
I had to do my own thing, on the other side
And niggas don't understand why I gotta rhyme
I freestyle to the end of the day
People tell me "How you do it at Sway?"
And if you want a freestyle, call me up
Me and Chance in the studio, rollin' up like
"What we gonna do next week?
What we gonna do next year?
Make this shit a mixtape
Or is it album of the year?"
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Man, I don't know! I don't know
I was sayin', like
People used to count me out
People used to count me out
But people used to count me out
People used to count me out
I like your music, ain't a fan though
I like your movie, are you Lando?
I like your show, are you around tho?
You in Atlanta facing a lot, huh?
Are you in Atlanta doin' your own thing
Me and Usher in the studio
Smoking dope, rollin' up
Talkin' about what we're gon' do
I call Erykah and be like
"Yo, what you doin' tonight
Should we get on the mic like that?
Should we do somethin' new for them?"
Or do people just not like care, I mean
Sometimes I get kinda sad
I'm on twitter like, "What's bad"
I'm on twitter like, "What's good"
Me and my son in the hood, like ooh
Me and my son in the hood, like ooh
Watching daddy getting a haircut, sittin', like ooh
Watching daddy on TV, like ooh
In the living room moving to this beat, like ooh
In the living room move his little feet, like ooh
In the living room, rhythm real sweet, like ooh
We can go ahead and change the beat up, like ooh
If you know the time
We can feel it in time
In time
If you know the time
You can feel it in time
In time
Shit is feeling like the end of days
But I know this way is gonna change
It's gonna change
I feel Marvin in my heart
I feel Marvin in my heart
I feel Marvin in my heart
What's goin' on
Why are we still singing the same song
What's goin' on
Why are we still singing the same song
I hope, one day
We'll find a new song to sing
I pray, that's how it goes
Until then
I'm in the studio, hanging with the Migos
I'm sitting there looking like
People want to do that
People always want to talk me out
Count me out
People be like, "Ugh, he a nigga, stay clear"
Uh, uh, uh
And then they be like, "Nigga, oh shit
Oh shit, that's the album of the year?"
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know
I don't really got fears no more
I don't know, I don't know
I ain't really got, dreams, no more
I don't know, I don't know
I am runnin' out steam, sometimes
I be sitting down, writing like
Really, do I want this rhyme?
Should I spend more time with my son
Should I have a little more fun
With the people I think move on?
I lost people last year
Again, no
A friend though
On the phone with Fredo like
"What's up"
And then the next day I'm like
"Oh, that's what's up"
I'm a friend with Emmy like
"What's up"
And I get a call like
"That's what's up"
I feel like world's dying out
I feel like I'm running out of town
But there's nowhere I can't go
And people know your face
Like this
Yo, like with the cops
Freakin' out, walkin' in the room
That's on fire, holdin' a pizza box
I got that shit on lock though
People wanna talk top four
People run, they only move, sayin'
I ain't, got a new page to write
I am working on something I love
It's the last time
People like "put that shit out"
But it's the last time
I don't know, I don't know
If I'm ready, to end up, to end this
But I need some time tonight
To end something
Death is good
If it means progress, I confess
I got, I got
To change, rearrange, live in this phase
By the lake, sittin' by
My girl, talkin' about a world of things
Whether you gon' bring the 
Are you gonna drop this year
I don't really know, but I fear I will
And I know that fear, that I have, is good
Thank you for coming out
Love your screams and shouts
Don't mean to be a bummer
But I probably won't do Worldstar until the next summer
When I'm back in time
Please come around
Got something planned
Oh you understand now
I hope you understand now
Give it up for the band now
I really appreciate it
Thank you guys so muchRed's cargo is the best cargo
I confess, it is all I use
Red’s cargo is the best cargo
Without Red's cargo, I'd be blue
Ah-la-la
No-no-no, no-no-no
Oh-no
La-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la, laI wanted you to know

Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff tight
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you
The girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'mma flirt with this new girl
And I'mma call if it don't work
So we fuck till we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we was losing
I'm ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
'Cause I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well, two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she gonna play games
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-ffection-ate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related, racist
I give you money, then you burn it, like you Madoff
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?
I wish we never fucked and I mean that
But not really

Hennessy in my cup, I don't drink beer
I got gas, all I need is a Swisher
Drugs and bitches, what a mixture
You can tell I'm throwed, I ain't pretendin'
Stumblin' through the club, I'm kinda dizzy 
VIP flooded with women 
We know we winnin'
And I'm so so Mississippi 
I like bad bitches, I'm so picky
I might treat a model like she basic

You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you
The girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'mma flirt with this new girl
And I'mma call if it don't work
So we fuck till we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we was losing

Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she gonna play games
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy

You couldn't wait to date

I give you money, then you burn it, like you Madoff
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, "What the fuck you hiding?"

I'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon

Http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.30567/title.childish-gambino-says-rap-is-done-speaks-on-new-black-movement
 speaking to Peter Rosenberg
“It’s a pop album essentially,” Childish Gambino said. “We never wanted to make a rap album. I’ve talked about this before. Rap is done. Rap is done. I love Hip Hop. I love rap, but the thing it was supposed to do it doesn’t do anymore. Like I love it as a music. It’s the same thing as like jazz. Jazz when it was doing what it was supposed to do. And people still listen to jazz now, but it doesn’t have—It’s not doing the social work it’s supposed to do anymore. And that’s not because it’s gotten bad…It’s just a different movement. Whatever movement is happening now—Like I would like to think I’m a leader of whatever movement is happening. People call it ‘new black.’ People call it whatever, but I don’t want to name it cause it’s bs to name it. As soon as it gets named that’s when you start marketing it. And it’s like ‘Ah, this is hipster.’ Cause hipster was cool until it became hipster...And then it became monetized. Same thing with Hip Hop. So, whatever this thing is. Whatever’s happening. Like whenever Jaden Smith tells me he’s like ‘I’m real excited for whatever’s happening.’ He can feel it. I can feel it.”
Later in the interview, the Stone Mountain, Georgia singer/rapper discussed the lack of “a sense of balance” between races and also addressed crooked cops
“That’s the thing,” he said. “People feel like that’s an attack on something. It’s like ‘I get it. I understand. You guys are in charge. You don’t want to lose the power. I totally get it’…I’m not hating on that. I totally understand. I get it. I’m just saying there’s got to be a sense of balance. Same thing with cops. It’s like ‘I get it. You’re putting your lives in danger also. But what am I supposed to do when a cop who’s a bad person does something? Who am I supposed to tell? I would call you guys, but at the same time I know what’s gonna happen.’”
Gambino also addressed a controversial poem he penned last month following the shooting death of 18-year-old Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In the poem, he states “I wanna be a white rapper.”
According to the singer/rapper, he wrote the poem, which he says was “about freedom,” while he was “in the moment.”
“That poem was about freedom,” Gambino said. “It really was. It was about freedom. That’s what I wrote and I—People were upset. But yeah, good. A poem should make you . Like when was the last time someone wrote a poem that made you feel bad like crazy? That was heart. That’s how I felt in the moment…I just wanted to write about—I wanted to show how freedom is something that’s so great when you feel it. Like I felt it. I feel it on stage…I don’t hardly remember when I’m on stage most of the time. Cause it’s like freedom.”

Watchin old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation 
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith went off without a hitch man
C-H-I-L-D it's the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian
I've always been this good, you just weren't listening
Imma try to make my street cred stack up
I mean I'm rapping over Grizzly Bear, what the fuck
Gather swagger up, before I take it all
You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball
I started rapping cause I fucking need some Adderall
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods
I make you iPod hotter than a lighter would
Picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite
Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe
Kid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy
Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy
You better recognize, cause I'm no better now
Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital
And that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow
That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!
I'm wearing tight jeans, and nobody's laughing
More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins
Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman
I did exactly what you niggas said would never happen
I'm doing me so big I can hardly walk
These rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark
This kinda music make your balls drop, Dick Clark
Yes I'm grown and sexy, and I'm worth the wait
Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date
Put these words on your head and let them percolate
We need to separate church and state
I used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn
And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor
If living my life is what you say you're chasing after
Nigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper -moody when the dope freeze
They be sayin’ “Bino, this is your season!”
Y’all got’ to put up to shut up
I got the shit out the gutter
Watch out, my freestyle come up
Y’all know shit ain’t been fair
Y’all got Venalot skincare
Y’all make a good nigga feel embarrassed
Talk good like a nigga had ten parents
It’s all good like Rugrats in Paris
I just really like Rugrats in Paris
Me and my baby momma, we shoulda been married
Instead of tryna play God like I was Jim Carrey
Wasted all of my time inside a zoo just to end up vegan
All these farm animals prolly miss me tweakin’
All my kids gon’ be legends Chrissy Teigen’sWhat the fuck do y'all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
And niggas keep asking on whether this dude's for real or not
I'm not trying to come hard, I'm trying to come me
That's why these older songs that I used to make I'd release free
What's the point of rap if you can't be yourself, huh?
That's why I come first like my cell phone
I'm a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it's dumb, that's the fucking reason I'm doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
'Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend's baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she's sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That's not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
'Cause I ain't Mumford, I ain't tryin' to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain't the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion!
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
"Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
Am I serious? I don't even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain't trying, I'm doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R's a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short-shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, "I'd get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man"
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain't Curren$y, but if there ain't money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loves to text me Psalm verses
She don't look at me like I'm the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
And I don't want them missing a son like Bone's last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I'm grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with No I.D. and no I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
We need to find
We need to find
"Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"
I said, "Baby, I'm okay." She said, "Why you gotta act so strange?"See I be riding through my old hood, same old attitude
Chillin with your girlfriend, why she always mad at you
She be like “blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah”
Only time that she quiet, when my thing is inside her
Don’t you know I’m a writer
Yeah, I sleep in her stomach
And I slip her a 50, just to keep her 100
Yeah, my swaggers so dummy
We so stupid, so silly
I watch them girls getting lower than a kick in the milli
Gambino, why you got a gold chain?
Cause girls only gonna see you when you stuntin, man
I’m coming back, swag on Rogaine
Girl let me see your two chains on it
So hood, man what you talking bout
Man, I’m watching Law and Order on my grandma’s couch
Eating Lucky Charms for dinner
Loser to a winner
Swag so Clippers
Me and Blake Griffin
Me and Blake Griffin
Why your goals dripping
You even seen ballers like us po’ pimping
Ha, we getting drunk like a Kennedy
Ha, we stay fly like the end of Grease
Yeah, I got O’s like CP3
Don’t worry, don’t worry, don’t you worry ’bout me
I’m only worried when that period’s on CPT
When that period’s on CPTKill ‘em
It’s what I hear when I get a hot feel
In my nostrils
In my forehead
As I code red
You’ll be more dead than a horse head
In a four bed-
Room apartment
Bloggers that start shit
You want to criticize me?
Just so you can drink green tea
With Lykke Li at a speakeasy?
Wearing some American Apparel
While you’re staring at a Tim and Eric DVD?
Can’t get enough
Crime Mob shit: knuck if you buck
Celibate girls do stuff in the butt
Get it out with a Q-Tip, or some Müeslix
I’m a eunuch just cause I can’t give a fuck
Kiss her on her neck while she buttoning up
And my pants down
It’s funny how when I put Camp out they gotta camp out
Better than half of all rappers you have on your laptop
At your dad’s house
Hands down
Fake niggas said, “You the man now!”
Got a DJ like Roseanne’s house
Sam go hard like a handjob, nigga
Childish don’t go hard, what?
Now everybody wanna fuck with me, slut
The flow is too sick
Got them white boy clothes and that black dude dick
Now I understand why you gotta hate a nigga
East side! Stone Mountain-Decatur nigga
Y’all niggas lame, I’m fly as hell
Cause I’m fucking lame, and I don’t even care!These guys aren't tough and stuff
They can talk that shit when the chips are up
But the chips are down, cause i put them there
And i got a Hot Chip like the indie band
This is Christmas man and my flow is Miami
And the only goal that i have is my Emmy bitch
Yes and a nigga stay down like i'm into this
These niggas never did shit different, i was tired of it
See the other side of it, hate how they say how
Hip-hop is dead and everybody is the same now
I am not the same, how could i ever be?
I am so fly and on fire like a phoenix wing
I go light speed, you go slow pace
And i go hard like G-O in bold face
Used to do me cause i had to, now a nigga like to
Cause i get cheese like the mice do
I am a work of art, crush niggas like i'm crushing on Annie Clark
They stop sleeping on me
Good morning, like Alonzo
Go ahead and cut that shit out like a tonsil
Yes i stay weird and fuck chicks like i'm gonzo
Sleeping on a cow pie, tired of the bullshit
Dick is her baby, why does she abuse it?
Eight shots and a beer and i'm passing out
Glasses, leather jacket, i'ma ask you out
Spend the night if you got your own toothbrush
I really think i like you, but not too much
I got big plans, yeah i feel myself hard like both hands
Yeah I feel myself hard like both hands
This is all fun yeah, my work is vacation
Me and six shots, that's a bad combination
I don't need your money, this is free download it
Play it at a party, watch it pop like a soda
Thick indie black girl, double stuffed Oreo
Make a shit rapper pissed off like a urinal
You can not see me, i can change your perspective
Sick boy clique, that's an Animal Collective
Fuckin with you raw like i don't need protection
I am just a rapper, i'm in search of perfection
Spit hot shit, yeah my mouth is a toaster
Shit look easy like a turd in a short skirt
I am not a fairy tale, i earned this shit
Leave a track on the stove and watch me burn this bitch
Sick as a dog, fly as an angel
I am just a rapper, better learn sign language
Cause i don't talk, yeah i fight Teddy Ruxpin
Yeah i got paper like i just ate a muffin
This is all wrong man, this is all wrong
Have a nigga, have a hit, and then they sing the same song
That is so not me, i'ma change it all up
Doctor knows i'm sick dude, i don't need a follow up
Tell me when you can't take the track any longer
Weird soufflé and the noise make me stronger
I have gotten stronger, tongue like a shotgun
If you let the track loose, you can watch me pop one
Sick boy bitch, and it's back to the future
Cause i'm McFly and it's not what i'm used to
Cause they used to call me other name of a rooster
Sky is the limit like a jet pack booster
Fuckin with a nigga like he fuckin with a time bomb
Can't see a nigga, motherfucker turn your eyes on
I am so different y'all don't even know the half of
I do not talk, motherfucker i'm a rapperTires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up
There's a small crash outside
Yelling
VOICE: FREEZE!
GUNSHOTS
The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other
FATHER miraculously shows up in the doorway, larger than life, with an M-16 in one hand and a white tiger on a leash in the other. The tiger mauls Dude 2 to death
FATHER 
Boy, what did I tell you 'bout fucking around with these cops?! Dope game ain't made for brothas like you
THE BOY
Figured I can learn from the internet like everything else I've ever done. You were never there. It's all I had and all I ever needed. You think coming in here and saving my ass will make up for lost time? Fuck that. This all I got
FATHER motions the boy over with outstretched arms. Looking for some sort of appreciation for saving his son's life. THE BOY smugly denies the motion of affection
THE BOY
Don't play dad with me now! Too late for this fuckery. I'm packing my shit-
BANG!
FATHER kills his white tiger and now has his gun aimed at THE BOY
FATHER
You unappreciative sack of shit. Should've left you in your mama's mouth, boy
THE BOY dives for Dude 2's pistol which is now lying covered in blood on the floor. FATHER fires, misses and realizes he must reload. THE BOY steadies his shot as FATHER now has a full clip. THE BOY's phone is prone on the floor, somehow filming the action
BANG BANG!!
Two bodies drop. ZOOM shot of FATHER's bloody hand reaching for the phone. He shuts off the video and clutches his chest as THE BOY slowly pulls his bloody self up off the floor, pistol in hand
SCREEN goes black
THE ENDThe Boy and Dude 2 look at each other
A PHONE RINGS
The Boy picks up the phone
"HELLO, WHO'S THIS?"
The Boy puts down the phone
The Boy, sat in his room, removes his hooded sweatshirt and rolls over
MORNING:
KNOCKING ON THE WINDOW
EndsI'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
Childish Gambino

A vomit stain on my t-shirt
A sick boy but getting sicker
I don't really wanna take another marijuana
But I do it cause I'm stupid and it hits me I'm a gonerI do not talk, I am just a rapper
Motherfuck a nigga
Hell yeah I do it bigger
I got eight figures like I'm skatin' in the winter
Niggas thought that I was kiddin'
These raps are not my sketches
I'm a sick boy, nigga, when I cough I hope you catch it
My germs in your system, now you coughin' like asthmatic
All of my "I'm tired of it" turns into your "Wish I had it"
I don't need this money, but I spend it like I wanna
She said this dick is hers, I don't wanna take it from her
Your dick stay chilly, it's a cold, rough world
I get superhero pussy, she a PowerPuff Girl
Shit just got real like Pinocchio turds
Yo nigga is Geppetto, I don't want no instrumentals
Leave the vocals on my shit
Like the song givin' me head
And your bitch can't sleep cause she used to my bed
She could have any dick, you just mad she chose-d mine
Schoolin' all you niggas and my mouth will make it Columbine
I am just a rapper, man, I ain't got no clothing line
My clothing line has closed the line and let me shop at closing time
Yo boy got stacks like I'm standin' in a Borders line
Hidin' from you bitches cause real nigga's hard to find

Closet look like Bloomingdales, yo closet look like fashion jail

Stay fresh to death like a mint cemetery
I do not talk, yeah my life a library
Eat her out and leave her cold, make that hole my Ben & Jerry's
Broke the mold on you bitches, man, I am so unique
You are not a rapper, if you were you'd hardly speak
I am Stone Mountain and I haven't reached my peak
Fuck her like I'm mad at her then I turn the other cheek
This shit is amazing, check me in my sweater, man
Comme des Garçons, bitch, nobody do it better, man
But I do it better, man
When it comes to pussy girls whisper in my ear "No one else can do this to me"
You's a cutie but you gotta know I'm married to my work
And these niggas ain't shit so I guess they must be urine
Gotta gift this bitch, like Christmas, bitch
I'mma act and rap, Will Smith this bitch
When rappers start rappin' over indie shit
Just remember I was first to hit this shit
The difference is I'm different, bitch
How the fuck can these niggas be dickless pricks?
Man, what the fuck you gon' do?
I don't need to talk to you
I am just a rapper too
I am just a rapper too*Lyrics form snippet*

I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway
A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different
Right, that’s why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you
Can I have this dance?
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and uh
Nobody else matters

Yeah, ze kwam naar me toe na de show
De backstage binnen, en ze zei me
Hallo, hallo, maar wie ben jij dan
Stond je op de lijst
Zo niet, ben je d'r nou
Kom, kom er even bij
En nemen we de tijd met z'n tweeën
Spreken over jou en het leven dat je leidt
Maar ze zei, ik wil weten over jouw leven
Jou beter leren kennen en wat is de rede dat je naar me kijkt
Ik heb al je CD's, DAC plus je solo
Pomp alles om en om steeds in m'n auto
Kijk, elke tekst kon ze letterlijk meerappen
Elk couplet, letter voor letter, in volgorde voorbij
Ze zei, ik doe universiteit, net als jij
Maar ik wil iets creatiefs, net als jij
Ik heb een Blogspot waar ik lekker post over uitgaan, J Dilla en m'n nieuwe Nikes
En me hekelen aan die chicks die maar doen alsof ze hip zijn
Net als iedereen, maar die shit is niet voor mij
Dus ik zei, ja natuurlijk doe je dat
Lieve schat, niemand die hier zo uniek is zoals jij
Niemand die ik ken die hebt een Blogspot
Schrijft over J Dilla, mixtapes en m'n nieuwe Nikes
We zijn allemaal hetzelfde, behalve jij
En vertellen mij hetzelfde, behalve jij
Yeah

Believe in this, I'm tellin' you

I'm not that bad, the fun we had
Ooh

Weird voice catch beef like a lasso
New fresh prince, you can chill in my castle
Spit real shit, so I must be an asshole, right?
Nah, that's why I'm makin' out in your car
These blogs are a dude's A&R
Got a big tip for these girls at the bar
But I don't mean money
Ever since the money, they just treat me funny
Girls look good, she can take green from me
Ain't trickin' if you got it, know what I mean, buddy?

Niggas makin pottery, but I broke the mold
Now shit has got them dancing like I channel open fold
Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
And these hoes are actin' different cause I'm Rich comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me
I'm still f*cked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a f*ck
You know I gotta give a f*ck
My face is broken out
My shirt is hand-me-down
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shit and lay me out
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new clothes were the potion
Cause I never felt that good in my own skin
It's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool
Cause I wear thee tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt
Yeah, I'm self conscious
Go ahead - laugh it up
Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up
They told my ass ain't black enough
What the f*ck are you?
You don't even say shit
Quit writing gay shit
Now they see me and have to squint like asians
Cause I'm on fire and everything I touch is blazing
Giving you the realness
Kid I got a lot of it
Listen to my mixtapes, tell me if they contradict
Don't f*ck with these niggas cause this swag is asinine
I don't have time to eat
I don't have time to sleep
These niggas got time to do
Everything but be unique
I gotta do me like I'm jerkin' in the mirror
I am just a rapper
Can't make it clearer
Yes I'm in the building

Your girlfriend's sister... you cannot f*ck with me
Childish Gambino
We are all children
I am just a murderer
We have just killed themI do not talk, I am just a rapper
Nigga, I'm the capper
Rapper slash not actor
Cause I could never act the part of being fakey
You should really thank me
Who else would do this shit?
All that fucking wishing and waiting
These niggas are mistakin
You don't speak my language
Dressed like Ma cambridge
Bowtie make me muslim
Switch for suspenders
Two at least
Clickin through our hyperbeast
Tom Brown, Hells Bells, Kitsune, Jay L
I don't wear your shirt unless it got a logo
Now it's to go out and walk around soho

Check Kayne's blog for the high tops

Pink leather jacket, gotta get him
New t-shirt and I put it all
On a charge card
Burning through my go yard

Ain't nothing like new shoes every night
And it feels so good in the new jeans
And the new shirt, it's addicting
I'm an addict
I don't want help, I'm a die in my brand new Louis belt
But not Louis, it's too gaudy
Check the lime green frames this girl bought me
Billionaire boys club, I'm living it
One shirt, eight dubs
I'm spending it
Got shoes that I know I won't wear
And the problem is I don't really care
Got money, but nothing is forever
Every time I gotta buy I new sweater
By 211 I'll be dead broke
I'll be the homeless dude in a peacoatSee I be riding through my old hood
Same old attitude
Chillin' with yo' girlfriend
Why she always mad at you?

Only time that she quiet

And I sleep with a 50
Just to keep her 100
Yeah my swagger's so dummy

Watch the throne, kings kill when the prince feels power
It's the real deal, Holyfield, holy shit, holy grail

Hot on my own, check your tone, check your stance homie
You don't even like me, you just trynna get my fans homie
So nerdy but the flow wordy
Brain-freezin' with the flow slurpie
Ice cold but you know I burn cash like I had herpes
Not true, but I'm that dirty
Niggas quit bein' hot man, cold turkey
While I'm out in Kauai, man, soul searchin'
And these niggas be afraid and I'm so certain
Cause they don't know what to do when the world's broken
A lot of people try and go and talk shit but your girl stops me on the street
Like it's stop and frisk and a bunch of DDots wanna talk a lot of shit
But that's cool cause in the real world they really don't exist
It's all because the internet
Chance made millions, Haim made millions
Dan made millions, Kendrick made millions
I would too if I wasn't in my feelings
You know, cause like, people they say money's not everything
But money, you need money to do what you wanna do
Like money is power, honesty is power, truth is power
But at the same time they tell you like
Ain't nothin' more important than the mula
You ain't really eatin' boy, you gotta get your food up
We so steady eatin' baby, you already know that
The way I'm droppin' new shit, I'm sittin' on the toilet
Every night I tour that, moment
But we don't take pictures, when you're rich you just see it again
The only thing they really worry about is me and the pen
Wrote some shit on Instagram, I'm just bein' honest
They tried to give your boy pills like I'm bein' violent
They tried to give your boy pills just to keep him silent
Keep tellin' people the truth, you could be iconic
They tried to give your boy pills, like "he's scarin' us"
Try to stay inside, I don't really like appearances
I try to stay inside, but they still got something to say
"Are you still on the show? Are you dating Jhené?"
It's deeper than that
Calico inside the handbag, I'm keepin' the cat
I got some niggas in reserve like I'm deep in Iraq
And I'm deepening rap, and it's deeper than rap
This is deeper than rapAlright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk-About-His-Dick-Again
Nerdy-ass black kid, whatever, man, I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, "What is this nigga doin? Rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot, man, he think that we feel that"
Or "I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about"
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's? Nigga
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck a backpacker
Niggas with OCD, N-W-O
All white like my clothes, CW shows
Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly
No cosign: trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
"Man, fuck you nigga...fuck you nigga!"
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the Titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
"Super Bass," super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that payback, comin' on that mace took
I'm comin' on that real shit, I'm comin' on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick, uh
Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers880, 880

Umm, the summer I meet you after I graduated from high school..There's a bottom to the top of a moment
You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind you
People want you underground
Do you misbehave?
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run too fast
