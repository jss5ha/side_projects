Things I've written for fun and the Python Demos I wrote when I was teaching Python to 10-13 year old kids 

Currently has an rnn which takes a text file as input. Right now using the text file containing the discography of rapper smokepurpp in this repo.
The rnn will then output 1000 characters based on an input string and the text file provided to it. The goal is to write a song based on lyrics provided to the rnn.
