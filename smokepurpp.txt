Control, but not enough control to make the car crash

She in love with the pole
Yeah, Lil Purpp , watch how I maneuver 
B-Bitch I'm in the kitchen, and I'm whippin' like a scooter
Bad college bitch give me brain like a tutor 
Fucked that lil' ho and take a flight to Bermuda 
And I'm off the lean
Choppa stocked with a bean 
Yeah, shawty go , and she on the pole 
She don't like heat, but I think she like the scope
Blizz-Blizzard on my neck, make it snow in the nightclub
And she got a boyfriend, but I don't give two fucks
Got the bouncer trippin' 'cause I came in with my two cups
Bad lil' bitch give me head like Medusa
Thick-ass bitch , nigga, what's yo type?
Long black hair, hit that bitch from behind, ayy
I might spend a bag on that ho
Throw my cash on that ho 
Dubai bitch , nigga, what's your type?

I think that she know that but she in it for the thrill 
I need you to feel me 
I need you to heal me
I'm looking for love but I know that shit is torment
I hope you think about me every time it's stormin'
Because I think about you every time I’m pourin'
I'm a walking dead man 
I'm a walking dead man 
I tried to stop, but I relapsed on the Xans
