Bitches tryna come over and dine in
Throw 11 like Matt Ryan
Most my bitches and me are tight and
Hurt her heart with no Neosporin, then
I'ma watch it like WiFi
Clear water on her neck, nigga, don't see the shark 
Back to back, double R trucks, no key to park it 
Name the location, we mark it 
We gotta move the smartest 
I got a K in my office 
You ever seen a carcass? 
Growed up to be an arsoner 
Breathin' out fire, like oxygen
McLaren, it came equipped 
Pressin' the gas, and exhaust the whip
We get the strain and dip 
Can't pull up on me, come get your chips 
Heard car got flipped 
They might pull up on you with sticks in the Lyft
Hey, I'm countin' these racks up in the bed
I still took the pill, didn't know what it said
They catering Activis at the weddin'
I travel with the Draco or the 'chete
You think that she straight

Whoo, I gotta see, I was at the Grand Marquis
Divide the shooters 
Then split up the house
Intruder, the West Wing

The circle of bosses

Pull up with them F&Ns comin' out the hatch
Pussy mothafucka scared to say it to my front
So I'm blowin' out his back
Point it at his liver, make the nigga reconsider
Bands in my pants got me lookin' a little bigger

You can suck my pickle for a nickel

How many niggas standin' around you would die for you?
I’m not bein' funny but if I come through there sprayin'
All them niggas turn to 4 wheelers

Pick his ass off from the balcony
Walk into the house and change clothes
YSL, wipe a nigga nose
We don't give a damn if it's indoors or outdoors
We gotta have that, gon' grab that
Nigga go stab that, smack that shit
Every day I keep the bands on me, I'm a lick
If a nigga think I'm sweet then his tongue gettin' split
I ain't doin' any features unless you give me your bitch
I'ma fuck for the cash then she gettin' robbed by Tick
Eww eww eww

Hundred bands inside of my pants
Make the mothafucka dance on the stage
Aye, bitch, it's a parade
Pourin' 4s is a sport, Leanorade
50 whole k spent on my hygiene
Drinkin' so much lean that my pee clean
808 just might be the dream team
Bitch got some good brain, call her Pinky
Bag full of weed, no lighter
In the kitchen wrappin', rappin' like a cypher
You know damn well, I like her, I'mma bite her
In a Bentley on West Lee gettin' trailed by sniper
How the fuck you feel that I don't mean nothin'?
All them years in the bando, no clean nothin'
Runnin' to the cops, tell 'em I don't serve the fiend nothin'
Pullin' off like "SIKE!"
Bitch I got the bando, fifty hundreds
Spot 'round the corner filled up with onions
Big homie got a whole truckload
Me and Scooter take a trip to New Mexico
All I ever wanted was the money

So come a little closer, I might know you
Andale, andale!

Eat your flesh and stay mellow

She came through with Backwoods 
That's part of the reason I love her 
I'm her dresser, no bluffin' 
The  white marble dresser with a picture of you 
Put a hold on my schedule, put a reservation for two 
Shopping is a pleasure, and I feed your attitude 
Put you on a pedestal, take a trip to Cancun 
Trip to Cancun, how about trip a to south of Bali 
Keep a lil' leg room, she can turn a bedroom into Follies 
She'll probably take a bullet for a nigga, something these bitches won't do 
I can uno dos you 
Or I could split up the loot 
Show me your commitment, I'ma do the same for you 
Told me you gonna ride or die, so I bought a coupe for us two 
Italy her whole life, bought her everything brand new 
Diamonds keep me frostbite, I'm just tryna keep my cool 
Tryna keep my cool, that ain't easy to do
Get high like a skyline, need to give me time to regroup 
On the pavement so I keep that, now she feel like she in school 
Teach you game like a tutor, you won't fall in love with a fool 
You spend a weekend with me, I spend a lifetime on you

I'm her dresser, no bluffin' 
Ain't no want no cappin' 
I've been onto better things, these niggas so last year 
I'm in the back seat of the Maybach with a soul snatcher 
I just switched lanes and go slow, they probably still won't catch us 
Bae I love your accent, and what's your practice? 
Baby I love your practice, like I love my practice
Talkin' 'bout stripper practice, and why wall 
It's just all madness, chopper's a desert cactus
Range Rover autobiography, ain't doin' no slakin'
Ain't no more trappin', car too fast need traction
Bad lil' ten, she nasty
Diamonds on fleek, they dancin'
Woah, Oh
You spend a weekend with me, I spend a lifetime on you
You Puerto Rican, baby, you know your love is the truth

Big money like a jew, baby
Snake skin cool, baby 
We some pair of jewels, baby
Alligator shoes, baby
Lately, I've been travelling with a chopper, man
I didn't really mean to but I shot him, baby
 should admit it, I'm considerin' 
Their heart hurt, you got 'em sick but never mind 'em
Starburst piece so sweet I gotta ice it 
I'm too raw, rare breed, no nigga like me
Money turn friends froze, bros turn ho foes
Receipts gettin' so long niggas getting jealous, we just buying clothesI gotta foreign outside
I text her and she replied
She don't know when'll be tired
She wanna ride the dick the whole time
I know howaboutcha ball the Balmains
Gotta compensate her whole life
Get the sentence inside a suit and tie
Take the booty to me all the time
Aaayyyy
Imma sit inside my Mulsanne, take your time. 
I'mma king, I'm wait right here for my rock/ride
I like pretty people, with pretty feet, and real thighs
At least it feel like the truth when it's a lie, lie, lie, liee
I see a lotta pretty people not sure and "lie, lie" to me ....  
You can never never bash me
You can't ever say you laugh at me
You ain't ever ever have G
You can never never match me
With that rollie, nigga scrape the bowl
That my baby, that my centerfold
That my baby, man, she never leave
Got her hangin' with my kinfolks
She want everything I know, I know
She got Chanel purses by the loads
She wants the first in the US
She wants that purse with the LeSport. 
I spoil you
I adore you
I give you everythin' you want
That's what I'm tellin' you
That's what I'm tellin' you
I let you wild out in the foreign car
That's what I'm tellin' you
And Imma let you be the dog, let you fuck the dog
I'm very loyal
It's Nothing personal
And it ain't nothing personalWhat time it is?
What time it is?
I'm hot for real
You grinding still
I'm a doctor like Phil
I'm a Spartan for real
I'm trained to kill
I'm trained to kill
And I'm hot for real
You grinding still
If you trained to kill
If you trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill

Head ain't shit she must have dropped out of high school
Song on her ringtone, got it from iTunes
Instead of sayin' "Bye", you need to be sayin' "Hi" to him
Don't walk, don't run, bitch fly to him, dumbass
What you mean we ain't eating, girl you know my crew obese
And I smoke that strong every day like Wiz Khalif'
3 5 for the cheese shouts out to my big homie Pete
Let me talk Chinese, shouts out to YL and Wee Wee
Niggas talk bad, but they really want to be me
Threw 35,000 on him, Dirk Nowitzki

All the cultures love me
Aw yeahMano Bispo
Que os velhos tempos já não voltam mais
E nos meus sonhos reencontro quem ficou para trás
E eu choro por momento que não voltam mais
A vida ensinou-me a brindar os melhores momentos
Ensinou-me a separar os falsos movimentos
São sentimentos perdidos no meu pensamento
Os anos vão passando e as coisas mudam com o tempo
Só nos sabemos o que carregamos cá por dentro
É uma alegria ver-te rebentar com o movimento
Primeiras faixas gravadas no mesmo instrumento
E hoje apenas recordamos os bons velhos tempos
Mano olha só como o tempo voa
A minha filha já tem seis e começou a escola
E eu vejo o meu reflexo, mão firme no terço
Focado no importante e a seguir o resto
Eu dava tudo para o Xiko renascer das cinzas
O puto Nuno já fazia parte da família
Mas esta fucking life tem coisas que tu não imaginas
E os velhos tempos já não voltam mais
E nos meus sonhos reencontro quem ficou para trás
Mas conheci uma família que até hoje permanece
Ruas nos tornaram reis, a lutar pelos fieis
Cicatrizes, tatuagens, marcam a vida que eu passei
Tristeza no meu olhar, pelos soldados que deixaram famílias aqui
E hoje ao passar por esta rua me lembrei de ti
Éramos nós há muitos anos 
Hey, e os velhos tempos já não voltam mais
E nos meus sonhos reencontro quem ficou para trás
Acendo a vela na esperança que estejam em paz
E hoje choro por momentos que não voltam mais
E os velhos tempos já não voltam mais
E nos meus sonhos reencontro quem ficou para trás
Acendo a vela na esperança que estejam em paz
E hoje choro por momentos que não voltam mais
A malta quer que corra bem, quando és puto és inocente
Com bué pouco, bué contente, nunca vês dinheiro à frente
Com o meu Quinhas fora de horas, madrugadas às escondidas
Já tinha uma mala as costas, com caderno e com comida
Quarto piso era o destino, tipo que isso é novidade
Bué tardes de improviso, com os rapazes lá no quarto
Quem cão guarda, eu guardo tudo, menos mágoa não existe
Desde puto eu fazia tudo para não ver os meus  tristes
Que aos meus não falte nada, ninguém paga o que me dão
Nunca paka faça parte, de um abraço num colchão
O coração ja foi de maca, quem me abraça é a saudade
Obikwelu na batalha em Hamburgo, bem tratado
Lá fora é outro mundo, só quem passa é que sabe
Continuo na Tuga, até que esta vontade acabe
Lembra-te do tempo passado, permanece tudo guardado
Só não esquece o que passaste, para algo ser alcançado
No passado tu aprendes, as experiências são diferentes
Os convívios são frequentes, responsabilidade a menos
Vais eternizar momentos, tornar grandes os pequenos
Importantes foram todos, diamantes no terreno
Anos passam, vais crescendo, sem esquecer a raíz
Sítios que vou conhecendo, vou conhecendo Mem Martins
Um pouco daquilo que eu fiz, e daquilo que os meus fizeram
Haja saúde e peace, e o resto a gente gera
Hey, e os velhos tempos já não voltam mais
E nos meus sonhos reencontro quem ficou para trás
Acendo a vela na esperança que estejam em paz
E eu choro por momentos que não voltam mais
Os velhos tempos já não voltam mais
E nos meus sonhos reencontro quem ficou para trás
Acendo a vela na esperança que estejam em paz
E eu choro por momentos que não voltam mais
O tempo passo rápido, se ele voa, resta-nos voar com ele
Se ele foge resta-nos fugir com ele
Vivê-lo hoje ao máximo, que o amanhã ainda não existe
Tudo aquilo que viveste até hoje tornou-te naquilo que tu és
Todas as tuas ações hoje vão influenciar o que amanhã tu serás
Passo a passo compensa
Velhos temposUh, yeah, YSL in the building
Yeah, DTE in the building
Wheezy Beats
Yeah, slatt

Damn, and every time I thought about quitting
It felt crazy to the Thug, like something was missing
I had to sneak and do my thing, cause I didn't have permission
Now I'm in your back yard lurkin, pre-mission
I told them keep it 200, I blast for it
But he still keeping it 100, like his dashboard
The we ain't had nothing for credit, only cash for it
And if he sweet, rob him without a mask for it

Money in the sky, money in the sky
Money in the sky, I'm fly-y-yQ: Within 30 seconds of you rapping how often do you mention bitches, clubs, expensive cars and booze?
A: nothing in the first 30 seconds, everyone knows you want to wait until the 45 second mark..dick. And I've never mentioned an expensive car in anything, for what it's worth. No, valid question. I make a product for a certain audience and I'm good at it. Supply and demand, simple economics. I don't do this because I love the attention, I do this because I have a certain skill set that now allows me to get paid without the threat of doing federal time
Q: Remember don't sign with Turtle, he'll only get the white record labels to sign you
A: Haha, I just saw that episode. Saigon played himself out in that role
Q: What's your view on music piracy?
A: Piracy is good for underground artists, thanks to google people search the fuck out of songs to find the original artist. You end up getting more exposure as a indie artist. At this point I'm just happy my music is getting out. My management hate the shit though and now that music is the product they see piracy as money out of our pockets. I focus on music, I let them stress legalities and royolaties
Q: How did you first release your music into the public sphere? How did you start to generate publicity for yourself? What advice would you give to people who are trying to pursue this same dream?
A: I just started doing a shit ton of collabos with other artist that already had established followings
A strong and constant internet presence, a street team out promoting shows and appearances, You have to have a team you trust, people that know their talents and understand your vision and your goals, people who let you focus on your talent, believe in you, and will call you on your bullshit in a minute
Q: How old are you and what crimes have you committed?
A: 19, I sold weed and pills until a year agoYeah

Hey
Fishtailin' down the parking lot of Magic City 
Penthouse, woke up in a mansion bedroom full of bitches 
Snitches get stitches, we put chopper bullets through your tissue 
And that don't mean that you real because you got a pistol 
I do this shit for my niggas , all of my niggas official 
All of my niggas tote pistols , all of my niggas be killin' 
All of my niggas drug dealin'
Came from the trap, I could barely sleep
On that molly, I could barely eat
Just popped a percocet to get on my feet
Feds in the spot screamin' "Get on yo' knees!" 
They hit the spot for a elbow 
Just took a loss on a elbow 
The people's choice on a elbow 
I'm pretty sharp with my elbow

That's what you told me , this what you told me , ayy
Last night felt like our first night 
Back when you was 'bout that life 
Invite two friends, hit it three times 
You don't get jealous, I can see now
Yeah, I think we needed that space 
You know them hoes gon' hurt, hurt
Morning turned into noon 
Off the Hen' and Goose 
Didn't we stay, didn't we stay in the room? 
We both have things to do
We both got things to lose 
Suction, gave me that
Vampire , big eruption 
I don't get tired, long stroke
Back stroke, kick back, that's mine
Pull up on me , pull up on me

I spent a mill' on a watch
Hop out the drop like a Pop-Tart
I'm Gucci Mane down to the socks 
Coachin', I call all the shots 
My AP is wet as a yacht 
Last night, she told me she love me
But now she act like she forgot 
Tonight is my night, so I'm fuckin' her twice
Ballin' like it's the last night of my life
Big diamond crosses like Holy Christ
We flyin' at night just to blow on my dice
With Huncho and Derulo, the car came with a umbrella 
The Maybach seats like pillows and the Lambo truck bright yellow 
Last night , last night 
Last night , last night
That's what you told me
Last night , last night

You fucked me last night 
Said it's for the last time 
Diamonds on my chest, they bite 
Hit the club, change the climate 
I can dress you righteous 
Pussy better when you feisty 
That's my girl overseas 
Love you way more than lean 
Make it roll like it's weed 
Make it roll like it's weed 
Last time, you got freaky 
Back it up and pose
Stunt on all these hoes
Baller, strike a pose
Go get whiter toes
You can bite my pole
Girl, just let me know 
Do you remember last night?

Touch your toes, bend right over, girl, and touch your toes
Made a bag on the road, came home, bought a Rolls

If rappin' wasn't workin', I always had a stove 
Put some diamonds on her from Tiffany 
And her ass look Japanese 
That bitch Blackanese , Skip

He got caught on camera killin' niggas, yeah, but we not
And I'm saucin' bad, bitch, I'm flyer than a eagle
Upset stomach, got three stripes just like Adidas
Exes say they miss her bad but they never see her
Bitches say my bitch is boring then they wanna be her 
Bitches say my bitch a fraud then turn 'round and wanna be her 
I'm just 'bout that cash talk, I'm signing checks 
I don't fuck with planes, I'm on a private jet 
Throw a private part, call it Project X 
Pull up in a Rover then demand respect 
Dynasty, ran up them Gs
Drank you some lean, turn a ho to a freak
Karate-ooo, like Goku-eee 
Toilet stools, I'm shittin' on these
Dominos, got bad hoes

I'm sittin' on top of the world, I'm mountain high, hey
Woah
I'ma turn up every time I think about a nigga
Turn up every time I think about a nigga
Up in my house, then I go and hop out the shower
Then I go and down me a ounce
Hop in the car, then I go let off the top
Then I go and look at the stars
I'm one of those, I see that bitch from afar
I'ma throw it like Brett Farve
She do her job, suck me like corn on the cob
So many bands, it's a fraud
Go to her job, then I'm gon' walk in her job
Then I'm gon' cum in her jaw
Hennessy boys, we are the Hennessy boys
 remedy boys
I'm tellin' his broad we are the TTG boys
I'm in love with the Birdman 'cause he in love with me, broad
I will never never forgive you
So you might as well stay away
I won't ever ever forgive you
No way, no way, no way, no way
He ain't goin' down like that
Pay the lil' bitty bitch while the bitch go down like that
Young nigga bangin' red like the nose on a clown like that
So you just gon' tell me you stealin' my sound like that?
Okay, okay, okay, okay then
Let them bitches spend the night, she tryna stay in
I can't be with you, baby, you cannot lay in
But  that's what I'ma lay in
I'ma use your titty for my pillow, baby, baby
My Maison Margielas the latest, latest, latest
I could've took care of ten of them little babies
Nigga want war, he better pull up with the Navy
The way I'm ballin', it ain't basic
I beat a case and then I went and bought ten cases
Ace of spades, pour it on her fragrance
Call of Duty, I hop out with TECs and them Uzis
I drink that Actavis until I wake up woozy
Boulevard, poke it
Brought me bitch, she was the bomb, a lotus
I got my ice off the Titanic, it was cold as shit
I hate you like you let my blunt get moldy
I will never never forgive you
So you might as well stay away
I won't ever ever forgive you
No way, no way, no way, no wayForeign money
Ever since a youngin' don't wanna be that nigga, yeah
So fuck 'em
I told my momma "Fuck a job, shit I'm trappin', I done got in too deep" 
Never follow rules, shit, that school shit wasn't really meant for me 
Ever since the day granny died, it fucked me up mentally 
So I stay strapped up ready to ride on all of my enemies 
Young niggas'll shoot on the block just tryna get famous 
It's only one rule on the block, don't sell dope to strangers 
Hunnid 'round yo' toolies, you not really good at aiming 
'Cause they gon' do the foolery for that guap and how could you blame 'em? 
Fuck 'em , fuck that bitch but don't trust 'em 
Got the type of D that put a hoe to sleep
I'ma be skeetin' Robitussin 
Then wake up and make her roll a Sweet 
That lil' bitch know about this thuggin' 
Speak to him forever, hold your peace
 ain't no ho in me 
See, niggas be talkin' that gangsta, but when it get gangsta, they hide 
They walk in, they dressin' like gangstas, but that's a disguise 
I remember the days when I used to slap niggas for lyin' 
But I ain't the same nigga I was and you better thank God 
'Cause these niggas pussy, they pussy
Chop a nigga and they ain't do shit 
Hop out on foot , smoke a nigga like kush 
And I ain't sayin' I'm a killer 
Well, pussy nigga, don't push 
I'ma trapper turnt rapper, it's gon' cost a half a bird just to book 
For real 
No hysiding

As you can see, I just made Stevie Wonder  
I'm standin' on the mothafuckin' block with the rocks in my pants, yeah

Big Will had dog food before Ralo 
Back when we was tryna kill each other with hollows
Ooh, I wore Fubu before a coupe

Short and long term goals, I completed all those
Even though I drape her down in clothes, hate to see the bitch in clothes 
I draped her up with clothes and I  like she 
I pressed up all my woes and they way across the globe
I do the rose gold Rolex with pink golds
Got a pink pink Molly in the bag, pink toes
I iced out all my hoes 'cause they like my neck on froze

Nigga spittin' flames like a Cheeto
Every nigga around me remain G'd up
I hate old school, but I got one T'd up
The nigga with me got three stripes, Adidas
I was too cool for school, I trapped with a beeper
First, I was goin' to school, then turned to a reaper
I was just sellin' this reefer to get me some sneakers
First, I was busy with her, but now you can keep her
Started gettin' dizzy for it and I had to leave her
I was just smokin' sativa, I was just swipin' and sellin' the reefer

White diamonds on her like the Klan Klu Klux
I could shame all you hoes, I done fucked you like a slut, yeah
She gon' let me fuck, I put my thumb right in her butt
Sippin' on that lean, I need some ice with double dups
I just fuck these hoes and I can't love 'em, I just lust
And these bitches ain't shit, I done been lost all my trust
Hanukkah, that's the name niggas give to a slurpy
That's the gang that had gave me birthy
Hit or miss, I will never get discouraged
Every day, I get a bag, I guess it's workin'
I been fuckin' up them , I been splurgin'
Choppers with me and some killers like we Persian
They love my music and they feel it, I'm emergin'
And they know they I'm the realest, but they hurtin'
I put my dick in her mouth, I'm not takin' it out
I came out the jungle with nobody makin' it out
She suckin my dick, I got her all on her knees

Run up on you with that carbon, 40 clip into his noggin
They vicious
Your bitch is naked washing dishes
She like my lifestyle, she say we live too religious
Two thousand for my gators, them bitches look itchy
Bitches got bumps, and I’m rich like Donald Trump
Driving around with that pump, pockets look like a lump
Weed smelling like skunks, blunts big as a stump
Bitches wan’ fuck Young Thug and they wanna fuck on Duke, uh
Thugger not with the bullshit, baby I just want fun
Boolin’ out in the  baby, I came up off midget

We so high off life, and we ain’t got no fucking option
Reel them ducks in, we call it going fishing
Washing machine all that money, we call it cleaning dishes
Making birds take a bath, we call it shaving pigeons
And I ain’t PeeWee Longway but your ho know I’m dealing
I’m cold hearted, I don’t got no feelings
In that new drop top, I don’t got no ceilings
The roof is absent, ball like I got cancer

Told my baby next February we're married 
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious 
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
Yeah!
Aye, I fuck that bitch just like a centipede 
I'm not no pussy, so they on my D 
I flood out shawty's wrist and now they digg 
I'm whippin' soda up in NOLA, bitch 
The inside of my car lizard like a sofa, bitch 
I wear it like Cinderella, then I smoked the bitch 
Hey, my ice is skating, where my roller, bitch? 
The dope can get a lil colder, like a polar, bitch 
I, answer the call then put it right beside me 
Two, hundred on that pussy like the new Spyder 
Keep, your mouth closed, I'm the supplier and buyer 
I, just might one night her, I might go and wife her 
Hey, I'm bangin' green like the lizard with Geico 
I, might catch you and burn your top like Michael 
I, got bullets bigger than fingers in rifles 
No Chief Keezy but I might bite her, then
I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion 
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian 
Told my baby next February we're married 
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious

Whippin' that snow, no Alaska
Good head, she got her masters
Shawty a long way from dumb
Your money flat like a plasma
Good kush, smoke is the bomb
I drink that Act while you be drinkin' red
I don't fall in love, I run over it instead
Hey, babe, bobble, that big ol' head
I'm like, "lil baby, I don't know your kid"
I keep my pistol I'll give you the lead
They 3 deep I call 'em Ed, Edd and Eddy
Baby take a picture, get that photo cred
She make me lean back like a sofa bed
I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion 
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian 
Told my baby next February we're married 
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious 
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings 
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean 
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme 
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team 
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
Yeah! 
So I told my bitch where the stash at 
Before I get locked up, I know she know where the cash at 
She a red bottom killer, her ass fat
If I light one up and she gettin' fucked up, she like "pass that" 
If she ride shotty and it come down to it, she'll blast that 
And Lord knows that my niggas is home, but she past that
And forgive me though, 'cause I think that I'm having a flashback
Down in Miami I ran in the mansions, you backed out the driveway and crashed that 
Well we livin' that life, no hashtag
Shopping sprees, 4 or 5k, ballin' hard for your bag tags 
I got good dick for your bad ass
Can't slow down this fast cash, so we take trips and don't pack bags
I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion 
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian 
Told my baby next February we're married 
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious 
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme
They ain't gon' play with me, no no 
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team
They ain't gon' play with me, no no

내일 아침
나한텐 안 일어날 줄 알았던
일이 지금 내 눈 앞에서
일어나고 있어 난 입술을
깨물어 적응 안 되서
시간은 지나가지 여기 컵 안의 얼음이
녹을수록 나는 더 불안해져
멍청한 인사는 절대로 안 되지
쳐다만 보면 날 변태로 알겠지 아 후
몰라 어차피 난 한 번 살잖어
몰라 어차피 잠 못 자
이렇게 나 집에 간다면
잠깐 나 같은 거 여러 명 있는 거 알어
너가 같은 지 다른 지 좀 들어봐 줘
무슨 말인 지 이해가 안 간다면
잠깐만 나랑 나가

내일 아침
잠이 오질 않아 뒤척여
눈을 감아도 네 모습이 너무 선명
해서 가슴은 터질 듯이
기차소리를 내는 주전자 같아
너가 나를 끓게 해
너는 맑은 하늘에 걸린 구름
또 늦은 저녁 은은한 스탠드 같기도 해
넌 형용할 수 없이 아름다워 babe
더 기다리게 하지 말고
내 손을 잡어 babe
난 어디든 날아갈 거야
그래 거기가 어디든
Young rich & famous
그때 내 옆에 너가 있었음 좋겠어
Baby 그저 너는 너이기만 하면 돼
너가 날 보고 웃어준담 난
그걸로 됐어
들을 진 모르겠어 babe
알아둬 너를 위해 I made it

너는 아름답고 그런 너가
이 노래를 좋아해준다면
나는 하루 종일 니 생각에
웃고 다닐 거라는 걸 알어
야 요즘 멋지게 지내 친구들과
이루고 있어 내 멋진 미래
근데 너가 나랑 같이
내일 아침에 눈을 뜬다면
그게 쌈뽕이지 이제
저 새끼들은 멋 없지
너에겐 턱 없이
부족한데 뭣 하러 시간을 낭비하니
걔넨 멀었지 말을 말어
넌 달러 better than hoes
Who I have seen before
내 마음 정지용 시인의 호수가 됐지
내가 전세기를 타고 하와이를 갈 때
옆자리서 아름다움만 변함없으면 돼
그녀는 내 옆에 없지만
그녀는 내 곁에 없지만
그저 일방적인 내 이기심으로
너에 대한 노래를 만들었어
꽉 끼는 청바지에
그 위로 보이는 볼륨감
그리고 나를 홀리듯
쳐다보는 눈을 가진
너가 이 노래를 좋아했으면 좋겠어
Babe 너가 좋아했으면 좋겠어

Lil’ lil' mama never fell for it 'til I bust her
And you a pretty, pretty girl, no cover
Fuck you with no rubber
Since your family don’t like me I'll let shots go at your brother
And your body look like gold when we fuck in Versace covers
Just because that pussy good, that don't mean that I'ma trust you
That crazy bitch stalkin' my brother Thugger
She caught me creepin' with my old ho
She ran up like "yeah, yeah," I was like "no, no"
My lookout man was my right hand but he was wrong though
Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor's porch
And it was her, she had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent
She had the same exact face as my brother's nurse
And he in a hearse, I never looked at it for what it’s worth
So I never made love, never made love 
Never made love, never made love 
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love 
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never ever ever ever made love
Never made love, never made love

When she open up, I'ma taste her 
X out everyone and then erase her 
I’m sorry for lyin' to your face, yeah 
I'ma marry her and I bouquet her 
Leavin' out the house drunk and she stumbles 
Be all on her mind, she can’t even think of 
She walkin' off, I look at her like cable 
Boolin' with your partners at a party, ayy 
They don't even know what the fuck love means, ayy 
She say she never waste time on me 
Yeah that came out of your jaws, baby 
I heard it, even though I suck it 'til she lockin' up 
Lockin' up like handcuffs
Give me all your time, every day 
Girl how come we never made love at your spot? 
Cause you ain't want your other rich homie be findin' out 
She want it so I spent 12 thousand on a lil' rug 
I'm just tryna tell you, ain't tryna make you look low

She won't T.I. on me, she don't care 'bout no money 
Hey, hey

They trip out all the time, tellin' you I'm on some bullshit
Parallel parkin' that pussy, they like my motion 
Put that on my mama, now Stunna know that I'm loaded 
When my partner see it he stand up like he on Folgers 
I ain't like that shit so I hit him right in his shit
Then I told him, "don't ever do that shit there again" 
How you feel if I see your ho and fuck on the kid? 
I'ma catch a body if she leave me, I'm not playin'
Yes, I said I'm the best and I put that on the red
When you make me mad I tried to get back and get some head
And I know that's wrong, but my dumb ass still did it instead
Then I put the strap to my own head like boy I'm on one, woah
Then I told her don't ever do it again 
Every guy you look at, I'll turn him to wind 
Yeah, then I looked up at God like yeah
Then I realized I'd never made love, never made love 
Never made love, never made love
