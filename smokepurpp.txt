Swear to god I met in my motherfucking dreams before
That girl, that girl
Swear to god I met her in my motherfucking dreams before
In my dreams before
That girl, that girl
Swear to god I met her in my motherfucking dreams before
In my dreams beforeWhoa
I got skinnies up on my Glocks, still fit in those 
I put a hole in him, now he a walking Cheerio 
Type to fuck your bitch inside your house and eat your cereal 
He said he a tough guy, turn his bitch into a widow 
I'm the type to fuck your bitch and sneak out through the window 
You the type to not fuck and start talking to the pillow 
I'm the type to walk inside the store and tell 'em, "Bill those" 
You the type to walk inside the store and try to steal clothes
And I keep that Glockie, bitch I'm quick to blow a face off 
I got two white bitches topping me, having a face-off 
And I keep my 'migos with me, like my name is Takeoff 
How the fuck you ballin' and don't got a bed to lay on? 
I be on my Elon Musk shit, so high that I'm outer space 
Bitch, don't get too cocky, there's hoes in line that want your place 
If it's opps in here, then fuck it, we 'gon let it spray
Them 223s will turn your head into a different shape 
I flew the bitch here, fucked her then I flew her back 
I might vacuum seal a bitch, and treat her like a pack
You can turn the lights off and my diamonds tell you where I'm at 
Run up on me, I'll leave ketchup stains all on your back 
I fucked her, I passed her, hot potato 
Bitch, I'm playing with this money like this shit is Play-Doh 
I'll knock his head down to his feet, he Mr. Potato 
He came looking for a lick, he left with a halo 
I got skinnies up on my Glocks, still fit in those 
I put a hole in him, now he a walking Cheerio 
Type to fuck your bitch inside your house and eat your cereal 
He said he a tough guy, turn his bitch into a widow 
I'm the type to fuck your bitch and sneak out through the window 
You the type to not fuck and start talking to the pillow 
I'm the type to walk inside the store and tell 'em, "Bill those" 
You the type to walk inside the store and try to steal clothesThey tried to feed me lies, yeah, they think that I'm playin'

Bought all-white Forces, I got mud on 'em
These niggas mad 'cause these bitches wanna fuck on us
Quarter-mil', stuff it all in the Chanel bag
Sure these bitches pop their pussy when you get a bag 
And you can't trust these snakes, they gon' tell on you 
Turn around, they'll prolly put the Feds on you 
They really salty when a nigga get a pack
So I matted out that Lambo' just to get these niggas mad

Seventy thousand on my wrist, an AP on that shit
Bitch, I came up out the mud so I can talk that shit
I'm in Cali, I'm still actin' like a Florida jit
Fuck a .22, I'm ridin' with a stick
All this money, how I'm s'posed to trust a bitch?
Only chase the bag, and I'm like, "Fuck a bitch" 
Brand new Ghost and it's not rented
Had to tell 'em, "Fuck the tints," so you know who in it
Had to put on all my jewelry so you know who winnin'
And if I ever take a L, it's 'cause the Glock went missin'
Fuck niggas ran up on me but they couldn't finish
They don't want this shit, they hate to see a nigga winnin'
Tell all the opps I say, "Fuck you," 'cause I got plenty 
My young niggas drop a nigga for a light twenty 
Bought all-white Forces, I got mud on 'em
These niggas mad 'cause these bitches wanna fuck on us
Quarter-mil', stuff it all in the Chanel bag
Sure these bitches pop their pussy when you get a bag 
And you can't trust these snakes, they gon' tell on you 
Turn around, they'll prolly put the Feds on you 
They really salty when a nigga get a pack

Gave me so much brain, bitch came with a pen 
So much brain I'm nutting SAT questions
Five thousand dollar jeans for a bitch to sit on 'em
Me and you are not the same, to me you're an antonym
If I spin the block one time, I'ma probably spin again
Told the bitch I want that sloppy, lil' hoe spit again

1 pill, 2 pill, 4 
1 pill, 2 pill, 4

1 pill, 2 pill, 4 
I just want to pop another pill

1 pill, 2 pill, 4 Lyrics from Snippet
And the plug mixed the Perky with the Adderall 
All these beans in the lean got me nodding off , yeah
Send me all the Percs to  , ayy
 just to ball 
...Niggas can't outshine they last move
Got an Uzi with a stick, make the block move
Water, baby and I keep a drum too
I dropped a whole show on my new shoes
Niggas can't outshine they last move
Got an Uzi with a stick, make the block move
Water, baby and I keep a drum too
I dropped a whole show on my new shoes
Ridin' 'round the block with a freak bitch
Ridin' with the Glock and the tree, bitch
And my hundreds blue but I ain't a Crip
She say she like my sauce and the way I drip
I ain't got no squares in my entourage, push start Mazi in my car garage
Sippin' on the lean got me fallin', I feel like James Jones the way I'm ballin'
Sippin' on the lean got me fallin', I feel like James Jones the way I'm ballin'
I just want the neck from a freak ho
I don't trust a soul, so I keep a pole
.223 shawty with a telescope
Nigga talkin' down I'ma blow his nose, blow his nose
Niggas can't outshine they last move
Got an Uzi with a stick, make the block move
Water, baby and I keep a drum too
I dropped the whole show on my new shoes
Niggas can't outshine they last move
Got an Uzi with a stick, make the block move
Water, baby and I keep a drum too
I dropped the whole show on my new shoesLyrics from snippet
Glizzy, what you cookin' up?
Purpp, Pump
Ball out
Yeah 
Bitch, I'm hangin' out the window like the laundry 
Big choppa fold a nigga like the laundry 
Popped a 30 and they thought I was a zombie
Stole the pack from my grandma, told her, "Sorry" 
Street nigga, whack a nigga for a house 
Rob your house, take on nap on your couch 
All these VV's on my neck like a jet ski 
Pop a nigga like a brand new Pepsi 
I OD'd on the Wock' then came back to life 
He don't need CPR, I'ma be alright 
Me and Pump in the hood, making bitches fight 
And you know I keep a dick like a  dyke 
Stole the MAC away from the motel 
, Mr. Krabs' shell 
Took a bitch to Uganda and she stay there
She ain't suckin' dick then I'll leave her in the motel
Wait, she suckin' dick? 
We in the plane, turn around with the stick 
I paid 50 thousand for this fit
Nasty ass hoe made my feet smell like shit 
You a bum ass nigga, you ain't got shit 
I'm a rich ass nigga with a chopstick 
Them .223's get your block hit 
Beat the pussy up like I play for the Marlins 
And I got the same bitch with the same kid 
I just popped up 30 Percs in the mosh pit 
Dive in the pussy, I'm goin' kick, boy
Rob a nigga in his own house, he ain't know shit
Diamonds on my teeth, flawless 
If I see a nine, I'mma drop it
Ooh, she sipped a pint, had an abortion
I just shot the engineer and now there ain't no recordin'
Keep my auntie in the head, my mistake 
'Cause I found out that she sip the whole way 
I'm the type of nigga to go spit on your face
I heard that she divorced so I bust in her face 
Been had a choppa since first grade 
Second grade, third grade, fourth...Tats on my body 'cause I can't turn down
Bitch I'm the best, I'm the youngest around
Smoke to the face, I don't pass it around
Raf's on my feet 'cause the money keep wild
I'm in a Porsche and I'm geeked up now
White gold teeth, I can't turn down
She suckin' dick, then I can't turn her down
Tats on my neck 'cause I can't turn down
When I'm in Florida they treat me like king
Packs of the percs and the pints of the lean
Rips on my shirt, I got rips on my jeans
Bitch I'm on go cuz my light is on green
Pistol tucked, in a truck
Bitch I'm stuck, off the mud
Ridin' in a coupe
Bitch I'm in a mood
Don't you dare to make a move
Bitch I got that Ruger, I might shoot
Tats on my body 'cause I can't turn down
Bitch I'm the best, I'm the youngest around
Smoke to the face, I don't pass it around
Raf's on my feet 'cause the money keep wild
I'm in a Porsche and I'm geeked up now
White gold teeth, I can't turn down
She suckin' dick, then I can't turn her down
Tats on my neck 'cause I can't turn down
Tats on my neck 'cause I can't turn down
Fuck on that bitch then I turn her around
Say I'm up next but I'm up right now
Nigga keep talkin', I'll empty the round
Don't need a vest 'cause I aim for the head
Fuck on that bitch 'til her pussy turn red
Ain't even sick, but I'm off of the meds
Talkin' too much, I'ma think you a fed
Ay, bitch my wrist iced like a cooler 
I'm fuckin' on this bitch, she a cougar 
Fuck your ex-boyfriend, he a loser 
Bitch I came up out the 'jects, now I'm boomin' 
Tats on my body 'cause I can't turn down
Bitch I'm the best, I'm the youngest around
Smoke to the face, I don't pass it around
Raf's on my feet 'cause the money keep wild
I'm in a Porsche and I'm geeked up now
White gold teeth, I can't turn down
She suckin' dick, then I can't turn her down
Tats on my neck 'cause I can't turn downOhhhhh

Push up on a nigga, need my money, big word
I’m getting nauseous to die in these Percs
Fuck on a bitch and the pill made her squirt

Fuck on a bitch and the pill made her squirt
Came out the mud, bitch I came out the dirt
Cash comin' in on the 1st and the 3rd
We try your man, and then put on a shirt
Had to get money, bitch I hopped out the Porsche and the Lamborghini truck full speed its a vert
Let the bitch ride dick, like I put her on sports
Still playing with draco's let the motherfucker squirt
They talkin' bout me, cause I'm never losing
If I'm losin', make sure they get put on the news
Got the game in a lock, had the bitch buy a new phone
I ain't gotta say shit to a bitch, she gon’ choose
I ain’t gotta say shit to a bitch I got two
Put the bitch in a Uber she said that I'm rude
And I just want the mouth, keep the sex bitch I’m cool
Giving game to these niggas I take them to school 
All my niggas got rich in 6 months, niggas really in the trap ain't no stunt
Really fucking niggas hoes ain't no front
All the ice I bought cost a cold front

Got a bad bitch on me she a nympho

Put two hands in a pot like a pimple
Fuck her face with my dick through her dimples
Still plain Jane on my wrist, keep it simple
Niggas hating on me they can't keep up
I still go to the trek, keep my feet up
Louis fur on my back they call PETA
Run up a bag and my bread got no pita
Play the bitch like I game on Nintendo
Said she want to leave me to the tenfold
I can't stress by the bitch, I don't need doe
If you 12 on the engine I speed doe
Tell the cops that we droppin' them no cap
In the boat with a glove and ballcap

        Sometimes niggas be feelin like this the realest shit I ever wrote, but like, that's every fuckin rhyme
Rewind that shit all the way back
Gon ask cause these niggas move quicker man
I passed away, gunshots, had to pour liquor
Swear to god I had to cry, streamin tears like runnin rivers
No one understand when you're livin just for death
Motherfuckers try to play ya, fuckin stab your chest
It's why I had to start drinkin, always fuckin up my kidneys
But depression is a bitch, feel it when nobody thinkin
But I can't just be the dealer, I'm realer, feel me
I'm proving through my actions, showing that I'm above the pillar
My job is to make bread, but money equals killin
If you think about it, everybody's willin' to get a million
Motherfuckers pay the price over losing they children
But for positive a  just be willin'
I can't stand to see them dead cold stairs and feelings 
I swear it's cold hearted but warm blood when you stealin
Death is a part of life, just get money, fuck a squealer
Feel me? And your odds is death, a ragin' bullet
But niggas passed away by the trigger
Now he's one in a million
So fuck death, you feel me?
How I still survive in your position?
How you gon survive talkin decisions?
Cause a nigga sittin
Man for real man them niggas don't even value friendship, shit
Ima do the business, makin money, shit
But when ya gettin up niggas, the people running and the streets is getting snitches man, golden like honey
I don't ask for help but I started askin for money
And the devil asked me, should I sleep with the thunder?
And the weather gettin gloomy man, looking like the booty
And the coochie started runnin, jealous of her boobies
Niggas, another, shot him, over some coochie
Fucked up, I can't believe this man, why he shootin man
Started with a joke, now he took it where he took it
Man you play both sides, but you can't dodge these bullets
Im a 10 star bitch, I'm guaranteed to fool ya
Ima guarantee what the fuck I do, what I say
And I'm cold on these streets, so Im strapped with a K
And I strapped with a 9, and Im strapped with the fire
And you know I'm comin in, cause you know I keep it real
Off that motherfuckin pill, bitch I show you what's the deal
I show you what's the deal, pussy30 rounds on a bitch

Countin up the guap, getting shoulder rubs
I get paid, make some cake
I need face, pour a trace
Skrrt off in a lamb, skrrt off in a Rari
Trappin like I'm Benny, trappin like i'm 
She do what I say so
Hit a stain then I lay low
Move around, move around
Nina on me lay a nigga down
Make some K, make 'em shake
Get that K, make some shake
She do what I say so
Hit a stain then I lay low
