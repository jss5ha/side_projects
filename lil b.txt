Yeah
Wheezy outta here
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments

Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard , charge it to the card

Run that back, Turbo
We started off as close friends 
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend 
We used to tell each other everything 
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool 
Lately baby been actin' so rude 
I don't know what somebody told you 
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'

But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time
We started off as close friends 
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend

I just poured up me an eight
Real nigga all in my face
Five hundred racks in my safe
Five hundred racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love?
What you know 'bout pullin' up in Bentley trucks?
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no hoes
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom, we used to wear each other's clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain’t my niggas no more
Hold it down for the four
In the nine with the woes
Marlo my dawg, that's for sure
We won't fall out about shit
Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gone fall out 'bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads

I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both of my ears on froze
I been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck, I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties, I pay for 'em
Get outta there when I wake up
I pass the ball, I don't layup
I'm a big boss, I got say so
They'll wipe you down if I say so
Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos
.40's, on .40's, on .40's
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint, change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil nigga, but I'm big dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Hit a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they'll never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, I don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lookin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryin' guess what I'm doin'
They tryin' guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits
YeahTay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Ayy, yeah
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
Yeah, ayy, look
I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover
Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, "Fuck it", I'm goin' on the run
You want it, my dawgs'll look out for the bond
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch
Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Boy, at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me "No" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind

Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active

Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', "Baby, please"
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?

Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, "What's happenin'?"

Good girl, turned her into a savage

Wanna do shows and make me some songs

Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve

It's too many mothers that's grieving

When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment

Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside

And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us

Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go

It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police

Remember that shoot out we had that time we thought a kid died
Only thing I know when we pulled up, everybody hopped out firin'

I'm just knowing everybody thinkin' we just pulled a homicide, homicide
See me on the news at the spot
Tryna see who they say got shot
I'm the first one stood up, told my brothers y'all all I got
Know if somebody seen us they gon' talk
Phone ringin' I thought it was a thottie
Thinkin' damn, "we just caught a body"
Hopin' everybody keep it solid
Fuck the nigga, I'm thinkin' bout the kid
The nigga shouldn't did what he did
I'm just glad a nigga still here for all the stupid shit that we did

Folks give yo ass that time, you'll never see the outside
All you do is think and wonder why
Kiss the good life goodbye
Now you gotta fight to survive, ain't no guns all you got is knives

Young niggas gone on the ice
Grown men fucking grown men they'll never tell you that part
Buy a phone you gotta have a spot

Rolls Royce truck pull up like, "Hello"
Pretty, tall, light skin, shake like Jell-O
If the bitch actin' bougie, I'ma take her to the ghetto
If I ain't smokin' Runtz, then it's probably Limoncello
You got a lil' boy, but you not on my level
Sell P's every day in the hood on my schedule
Young nigga give a ho whole groove like Stella
Jam don't shake like that, that's Jell-O
Made a whole M on the road, then lay low
I'm a real boss in my hood, I got say-so

Sticky-ass weed like Scotch tape

Diamonds on me, that's pavé 
So bright, can't see, that's a blind date 
Marley and Fee trynna get high weight

Only once the drugs are done
I feel like, "Where the hell is my grave?"
Heartbeat beatin' at a high rate
World stop spinnin', start to vibrate
It's a cold world, so my house in Miami still came with a fireplace
Pupils dilate, don't judge me
I'm with a sex slave, she like rough D

You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla
Spittin' these vocals, labels think I wrote it
Slippery wet paints, the coupes are candy-coated
Just left the bank, I need a bag to hold this
The streets like a farm 'cause all we ride is horses
Let my face tell it, we done made a fortune
I'm ridin' with my dawg and he ain't gotta question
I got a bitch like Keisha off of Belly
Police got dogs and they can't even smell me
Keep me a cup, I got a lean belly

Balmain my jeans, if not, they embellished
Too many vibes, they think I'm R. Kelly
PH in the sky, we got 'em already
PJ in the sky and I don't wanna land it
Creepin' at night, the VLONE bandit
I prayed to the sky and none of this was handed
Worked all my life and now I understand it
Crawled up like a mouse, but I could never tell it
I got the sweetest sauce like jelly
Try disrespect me, you all get beheaded
I got the drip, they call me Dripavelli
I held him down, that nigga was my celly
Fuck you fuck niggas, devil made me heartless
Thank God, came and got me, used to shop at Target
They cut out the coupe before we hit the market
We don't pack our bags 'cause we gon' shop regardless
Backend, I'm back in, paid up for the party
I done came a long way from openin' up for Carti
Shades and my bracelets Cartier Carti
Police's cases, all that we avoidin'
The lean in my cup gettin' more and more muddy
I shown all my love, I've never been a bully
Got every color VLONE hoodie
Just jumped in the game and still I ain't no rookie
I got this sauce, cream and puddin'
I came with the drip, got everybody lookin'
Cherish your blessings, easily could be tooken
Send a front in, it's easy to get a book in
You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla

Yeah, cash all my backends, I bought me a Patek
Addicted to cabbage, the money relax me

These camouflage denim like I just went campin'
They still can't believe that I made it, they happy
I been gettin' money before I was rappin'
I'm ridin' in the Wraith like I play with the actors
No pleadin', arraignment, ain't takin' no charges
My young nigga's solid, I know that he got me
He keep his mouth closed, I'ma buy him a foreign
Penthouse, hotel suite whenever we're tourin'
How foreign my tint is, I still rock the Jordan
Packin' out shows, love my fans, they important
And I'm still in the trap, in the hood like a motor
Spend thousands on fragrance, she fuckin' my odor
I just started rappin', I made me some millions
Man, shout out Atlanta, I'm runnin' my city
These bracelets came healthy, they cost me a 50
I leveled it up, I've been handlin' business
Gettin' 20 a night, every day, different city

Heartache to heartache we stand

Yea, I'm the young nigga with the sick flow
They watchin' how I move cause they know I get dough
Posted on the block, stuntin' with my kin folks
Nigga, you ain't talkin' money what the fuck you here for?
When I'm finna cop a crib somewhere by the rich folks
Same old young nigga used to kick doors
The whole world love me cause they know my shit cold
If not, I switch hoes every time I switch clothes
Pockets got knots in 'em, keep a couple Glocks near 'em
Long ass clip, know it got a lot of shots in 'em
Keep a bad thot with 'em, killas from the block with 'em
Pussy ass rap niggas always got the cops with 'em
That's why I can't fuck with 'em, never put my trust in 'em
How they gone react when a nigga get to bustin'?
Couple shots fired, watch the niggas get to runnin'
Niggas sneak dissin' so I just say fuck it
Really said fuck 'em, this is not a rap song
Boost Mobile Curve, this is not a TracFone
Contract free, what a nigga trap on
Inner tube, cocaine with the mustard on a couple
Pray the Lord keep me safe from who I fuck without a rubber
Prayer make me cold hearted, I don't ever wanna love again
Sacrificing random money, up and bought another Benz
Brother got murdered, I'll never have another friend
Now I'm blowing loud when our lounge got emotional
At times but the drugs help a motherfucker tuck 'em in
Diamonds in my teeth will help me represent the struggle
People in position recognize a nigga muscle
When you come up in the slums having nothing make you humble
Stomach rumble learned to kill without a question in the jungle
Scary ass rappers when I leave a nigga mumble
Got it out the mud, they respect a nigga hustle
I be tellin' my little brother
"Mane look you got a whole promising future in front of you"
He be ready to flash out and you know, go with his move
I really don't feel right givin' no good advice cause I'm in the streets thugging
I can get killed or go to jail any day
Shit, but by any means, we gonna fucking eat
We are strong, no one can tell us we are wrong
Heartache to heartache we stand
We are strong

Chasin' after cash, everything movin' fast
Gotta get it while you can cause you know it won't last

And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen
Call overseas, tell them youngins to spin again
I don't throw rocks and hide my hand 'cause I'm a man
Million cash in the book bag, I'm a big dog
Threw my shot at any nigga, bitch, I think I'm Chris Paul
Sippin' all these meds, nigga gotta be throwed off
I was gettin' head, fucked around and I dozed off
Rolls Royce truck, crank it and let the nose out
Everything I said, I went did it, boy, I'm the chosen child

I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen
Safe deposit boxes on fleek
And my bank account, I don't touch it, I'ma get it out the street
Got your vibe all on my drip, she say you cheap
And she know I'm havin' money, buy her titties, ass, and teeth
Catchin' three flights every day, the only time I get some sleep
Kept it real and they be cappin', really you can't compete
I spend it all on bullets, niggas don't wanna beef
Got a D-boy swag, pull up SRT
I ain't playin' with nobody, nobody gon' play with me
Got a driver for my car, he take me from A to Z
Got some homies on the yard I probably'll never see
If the money was the issue I promise they'd be free
They was sleepin' on me bad, they fucked around, woke up a beast
Switch it up, I went romantic, took my shawty out to Greece
Every city that I go to, gotta link up with the street
I'm too humble for 'em, guess that's why they thinkin' I was sweet
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate

Had to make myself a boss, it ain't no nigga workin' me
I invest a couple mil' and let my money work for me
Know they hate the way it happened, probably somewhere cursin' me
I don’t know nothing ’bout no killin', all I know is murder beats
I got rich and understand my next three cars gon’ be a lease
I ain't never losin' sleep about no beef, I roll in peace
I put diamonds in my teeth, came from grindin' in the streets
Get a load and break it down and sell it all and then repeat it
Pray to God for all the dawgs behind the wall, they need they freedom 
When I be on TV and perform, I hope they see me 
Once it's up, it's stuck, we get over on niggas, not get even

Baddest of the baddest, guess I gotta wait to pick 'em
Try us, then we smashin', then they go to playin' victim 
I don't know what happened, all I know is he got hit up
I'ma need a napkin, chains drippin', VV's lit up
I'ma get the money and go hard long as I get up 
We gon' beat the trial, I told lil' bruh to do some sit-ups 
Win, win, win, no lose or draw, I never give up 
Nigga, what you bangin'? What you claimin'? Throw that shit up

Yeah, we still so young and got so much to find
We can't never let 'em break our mind
We gotta stay strong, conquer and don't divide
I come in peace, my heart already set on fire
If it ain't color, what's the difference from you and I?
I'll let you decide or come up with some repeated lies
I'm just tired of my kind gotta be the one to die
Lookin' in the sky, I know you with me, I can't cry
Standin' what I stand on, I can't never switch sides
Sometimes I just wanna pop out on 'em and flip by
But I put my head on, I pray, I stay from off the route
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas, I ain't seen 'em in a while
Thinkin' 'bout my son, I just had another child
I been thinkin' back on bro, like, "What the fuck we gon' do now?"
On this road to redemption, this shit get rocky and it's wild
Let me tell you 'bout it
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
Know you be behind me if it ever came to this
But I never would've thought that we'll have to take this risk
Or ever be in this position, just keep ridin', don't go missing
If we in this together, this the way it 'posed to feel
I'm going out with a bang, I'm tellin' you what it is
If I get racial profiled where I live
'Cause my crib bigger than theirs, or my cars up to date
Or it's probably be my girl shape, they probably wanna date her
Or they heard I got my cake up, middle finger to them haters
My life finally matters, I got up and I'ma stay up
I know it lookin' like a dream, but it ain't everything it seem
Ain't no tellin' where I be if I ain't have God or ain't have my team
Can't let 'em trick me out the streets, I got a mind of my own
I left the house at sixteen, I told my Mama, "I'm grown"
Been through a lot of situations, I can handle my own
If I had only one call, I know you pick up the phone
If they ain't with us, we gone
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some restLook.. Say, lemme talk to you real quick, look...

Shouts out to A.E. for riding in that 6-0
Move fast, stick slow, think fast, talk slow
Dude try to play me, I’m leaving with his bitch bro
Sorry for the cuss words, fuck that, curse more
Bruh did things should've been in the Hearse fo'
Now I'm spittin' rap shit, gave me somethin' to live fo'
Hit him with the P-9, bet it'll make his ribs show
Rap game is too fake, real niggas lay low
Word around town that you livin' with a halo
Bet I got killers puttin' cash on Halo
No Xbox, shouts out to Tune, baby
Free Tune, baby, free Rocky, bitch
Free Rocky, free Rocky, bitch
Free Tune baby, bitch, free
Feel me, yuh
Bruh think I'm gay cause I'm grindin' in my tiny pants
Bet I'm the only goon nigga in these tiny pants
Sending off shots, kickback make your wrist jam
Fully-loaded thing on my arm like a wristband
You don't want the Space Jam, you're better off to vacate
No, it's no template to touch this, 6 Kiss, reckless
Hands around your neck like a necklace
Leave him screwed and chopped, have him thinking he in Texas
Nigga
Yeah, you know what I mean?
The mind is so complex when you're Based, 32 Levels
Welcome to my world, like I said I been ready
And it feels good to be here now
Finally realized, who's the rawest rapper?
 Lil B
Just cause you a rich rapper don't really mean shit
I'll come to your crib and clear that whole bitch out
And then blow the swish out, my mouth put the stick out
I can't be high and robbing pussies with my dick out
I guess I'm a show-off, take my raincoat off
I'm so wet that a pussy get mad at me
Switch cars, new colors, call it raspberry
Got my own website with the dotcom
Take it out the bag, over stove like Top Ramen
I don't sell coke, my niggas look out for me
They ain't wanna let me fall off the 
That's like losing Mike Vick on the Falcon team
We a faculty, but I'm the team leader
I pass you guys, I'm in the two-seater
And what's wrong with you, this is hip-hop
This that '09 shit, I call it Based World
I said I call it Basedworld
You know what I mean
So just to tell you, it's a wrap
To anybody that thought they had it
You need to think again
Throw your hands up, it's Lil B for Lil Boss
I need all the Based energy I can
Yeah, is this what you really want, you got me in the flesh now
No, I'm not stressed out, I'm God, I'm the best out
Rap transparent, my see-through glasses
It's incoherent, and no I'm not staring
I just see through you
And from your heartbeat you are soft in the middle
I'm real on the outside, solid in the inside, bitch, it's the Westside
Chopper in the trunk, leave em soaked like a wet slide
It's apartheid, rap game is my shit
I'm so sick, I'm feeling so nauseous
Somebody tell the Earth I'm the best now
Somebody tell the ocean I'm the best out
Somebody tell the trees I'm here now
Somebody tell the world I'm Based now
See me in outer space, I'm out of reach today
Celebrate for me, I'm Based for life
This a celebration, bitchAl Geno on the track
G just bounced back from a headshot
Trappin' by the roadblock
I only give until my legs out
Been a real nigga 'til my legs stop
Real trapper, my legs tired
Real trapper, my legs tired
Yeah, yeah
My life was hard, it just had to be 
Watch me turn my dreams to reality 
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me 
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily
Got a little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
If I had never made a hit, would they be on my dick?
I just been sittin' back and pushin' pounds, just gettin' fit
And I got a 60 on my right wrist, I'm movin' fast like lightnin'
These other rappers tryna bite me, your baby mama wanna bite me
I swear to God she triflin', I pass her on 'cause I'm righteous
I run the jungle like Tarzan, that codeine was like poison
I cut back, I feel awesome, no playoffs but I'm ballin'
Had a good day, I scored 40 and I ain't talkin' points
I close my eyes, I still have flashbacks when I was in the joint
I hit my knees, I'm thankin' God, I'm prayin' every mornin'
I check the schedule and I'm booked up, I'm finally tourin'
I'm goin' where I wanna go, doin' what I wanna do
I can screw who I wanna screw, I came from nothin', I can never lose
Turned my dreams into reality, I thought that you'd be glad for me
I can't believe that you mad at me, damn, dawg, I'm proud of you
My life was garbage, too, but I did what I 'posed to do
And I went and bought the latest coupe, told my young nigga stay in school
But he ain't listen, now he got a .45 in the kitchen with a biscuit ready to flip it
My life was hard, it just had to be 
Watch me turn my dreams to reality 
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me 
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily 
Got little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
I'm on top of all these niggas, I can see when all these angels piss
The way my nigga crossed me up, I thought his name was Chris
Don't wanna fuck around and kill my dawg, they gon' do me like I'm Vick
Yeah, they gon' really hate me if I sign a deal
I'ma go buy a Wraith, crash it on purpose, blame it on the pills
When Lil' Joe be slidin', it be look like he headed to second base
I see the hate, it look like makeup, it's all on their face
I can't see Fred no more so I be talkin' to his headstone
Sometimes I wanna catch a body, but I put my head on
Crawford finna touch down, he in the red zone
I sure got tired of sendin' him naked pictures of my red bone
Yeah, G just bounced right back off a headshot
Yeah, I won't fuck that bitch if she ain't got no ass shots
Put them choppers on the jet, we gon' air it out
25 hundred on some trap gear, we gon weigh it out
Too much dirty money, won't put that shit in the shower
Even when lights out, boy, that money still bring power
Can't serve a lot of white, but that shit look like baby powder
Got my gun at every show, I don't care if it ain't crowded
I barely sleep, but when I do, I just be dreamin'
They know I came from the bottom like bikinis
When I can't get hold to them Percs, I be fiendin'
Why would you tell me that you love me and you don't mean it?
My life was hard, it just had to be 
Watch me turn my dreams to reality 
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me 
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily
Got a little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name

You ever seen a thick ass nigga on your screen?
Just so fuckin' thick you wanna bust a fat gigantic nut over his elbow skin
Make him rub it in like lotion? 
Scrollin' through Pornhub, I'm on page four 
Cause I nut quick as fuck to these big booty whores 
Got my peepee in my hand, gotta watch the fuckin' door 
Cause if someone try to come in, then I ain't cummin' no more 
I got 50 thick latinas on my phone, they looking plump
Don't watch it for the plot, I bust a quickie off the jump 
She took that BBC and smoke that nigga peepee like a blunt
I can't reach a minute, I ain't even tryna stunt 
Bust quick as fuck cause Latinas is my issue
Beat my dick dry as fuck, I don’t use lotion or no tissue 
Whipped it out too fast I ripped my peepee on the zipper
Cause a MILF on my screen, I'm watching two thick niggas flick her 
Scrollin' through Pornhub, I'm on page four 
Cause I nut quick as fuck to these big booty whores

All of my niggas eatin' go and ask 'em

You tellin' me, nigga, that ain't burn out now? What's up? 
Started with a penny, now it's racked up to a million 
Rappin' rappin' niggas can't compare, they like my children 
I know bitches tryna get to know a nigga 'cause his digit
You a Honda Civic whipper, in my  chameleon 
We should start a group and we can call it New Edition
Maybe we can do it different, prolly make a hundred million 
I come from a place between the bricks where it was hard at 
Whenever I ain't around they talkin' 'flauge, I had to fall back
Wrist a Honda Civic, Lamborghini arms 
We get plenty pussy , nah-nah-nah-nah 
Don't you call me with it 
Boss nigga, we don't talk 'bout chickens , nah-nah-nah-nah
My Rolls Royce in the projects, they look at me like I'm God
Don't ask me 'bout no such-and-such, don't speak about no charge
I just stack my money different, every ten go in a rubber band
Too much attention on these rappers, fuck it, we gon' whack their man
Some shit I don't understand, I go get it, I never ask
I don't condone that robbin', but if you slime, suggest you wear a mask
Treat my niggas and my bitches all like players, buy 'em all bags
Wish I would've answered for the homies that I can't call back

Whenever I ain't around they talkin' 'flauge, I had to fall back
My dawg just lost his dawg into the system, it got me fucked up
I can't tell him nothin' negative, so I told him he gon' luck up
Had a bittersweet birthday, got a bad call in a Rolls truck 
Red guts look watermelon and spaghetti and some ketchup 
All my niggas leavin' me, this shit got me depressed 
Thought he was gon' wreck the Maserati or the 'Vette
But he on the yard with the old dawgs, they a wreck 
I missed a court call, what they said?
No more fake text messages, leave 'em all on read 
And this game some bullshit, but they payin' so I play it 
Cartier earrings, act like I don't hear what they be sayin' 
Keep that shit too solid, I spent millions on my family 
None of that shit promised, I pay cash, I take chances 
I don't understand nothin', I don't want no advance
Blood on these diamonds, they look good, they dance
Big truck pull up like a blue ambulance
Started with a penny, now it's racked up to a million

Jumpin' on the stage, look at the crowd, I got 'em goin' wild
Only rock the latest, they all on me, checkin' out my style
Chain gang, sittin' in the cell I had my first child
Mama tried to keep me in the house but I was runnin' wild
Sellin' nicks and dimes to the fiends at the West End Mall
Come through in a brand new Hellcat, I had 'em hatin' hard
You ain't got no haters you ain't poppin', keep 'em on they job
Came up in the trenches with them hustlers, I ain't have no job

The word is law, take care of my dogs, from my heart 
One for all, you gotta walk, we gon' march 
Ready for war, wit' my dogs, we gon' spark 
Started a tour, so I parked my foreigns in the garage 
Less is more, I pick and choose, keep playin' it smart 
S Aventador, my coupe's a sport, I lift up the doors 
Fuck these boys, the only thing I fear is God 
The only thing I fear is God 
You wasn't there when I was locked down in the pot 
Went blind, only thing I see is dollar signs 
Show me loyalty, I'll let you ride 
Just sip codeine 'cause I just gotta get high 
I'm savin' my cheese 'cause we done had hard times 
Flew to Belize, I needed a peace of mind 
I don't know numbers, I had to cut off my line 
Weave through it all like a 'tilian, none of my kind 
My clothes ain't wrinkled, but I gotta stick with that iron 
Your bitch is a cheater, we fuckin', she tellin' you lies 
The heat on these niggas, admit it, shit hard to decide

Need a rich bitch, I'm like where is Nicki Minaj
Money comin' in, like I play ball, but I don't play ball
And I'm supercharged, I'm a real dope boy
With designer from my head to my toe, I drip hard
I can't pull up in the hood no more, that's what I grind for
Feds tryna listen in on me, think I'm a drug lord
Had to make it to the finish line without no head start
Man I really came from nothin', all I know is to go hard
Me and Gunna, double R, niggas sendin' slingshots
On the tour bus with them killers, stay on Twitter, bitch boy
I want it all, the underdog, I go hard 
The word is law, take care of my dogs, from my heart

I think my past tryna haunt me 
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me?
What do everybody want from me? 
I gotta give it to 'em, if I don't
I might go to the hood, I'll make a song
Turn the trap spot to the studio

Seein' how I'm Oakland City only hope

Ain't got no time to waste
I've been havin' nightmares about goin' back to jail, so I wake up
Drankin' all this lean, poppin' Adderall so I can stay up
Niggas that I used to love actin' like they're mad 'cause I got my cake up
Ain't gon' never let it get to a nigga, keep on grindin', tryna get another million
Condo on Peachtree, I paid the rent for the closet
They just wanna talk about my past, they don't wanna accept the fact that I'm a boss
Everything I wanted, I'ma go and get it, I ain't trippin' 'bout a cost, yeah
Everybody want a piece of the winnings, they're never there when you're lost
Seen my main man try to cross me, I'm tryna pass it down to my offspring
All these hoes see me flossing, seen my first mil', felt awesome
They can't follow me, I lost 'em
Had to boss up, so I bossed up
Now I'm bossed up
I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now
I might buy that car if it make the right sound
Solitaire earrings bling blingin' from a mile away
I can't do what she want me to do, she tryna take my child away

She gotta be piped up to feel my emphasis
She hot, yeah, she sizzlin'
But can't love her more than a studio
Serena and Venus, yeah most of my chains tennis
So I wore it all to the studio 
My baby mama got pregnant, had to buy a bitch a car to get an abortion
She just wanna see tears and sad faces on my shorty
But I can't get mad, that's the way it go when you're fortunate
Leave a million cash in the street, nigga better not touch it 
Act like they came to lay hands so their trust don't get busted 
Straight from Mossberg to Hillsborough
Birds, bless the J's on that cizzurb
Ridin' in the Lambo that the lil' kids say "Bingo" to
My last two years were the worst ones in my career, but I'm still rich as you
Disneyland's where your kids go, on a private jet when I'm into you 
Them lil' bitches that be hatin' need to pipe down 
I can't wait around for nobody, I need it right now
I might buy that car if it make the right sound
Solitaire earrings bling blingin' from a mile away

Real lifestyle, nigga
Uncut and explicit
Straight up
Lord knows, these bitch niggas couldn't live my cold lifestyle
If you really knew Boosie boo, then you would run right now
Sick of all of these niggas saying that they gangsters
We don't rap beef like y'all rap beef, believe me, we spank ya
What you know 'bout riding strapped in a drop top
Finger on the trigger in the rearview Glock hot
Nigga tryna snatch ya girl from the hair spot 
Fighting extortion from the narcotics
Hitters on the backseat and them thangs cocked 
Burning niggas homes 'til they run out
At the graveyard watching my homeboys
Momma cried tears so you know that it's on, boy
Picture perfect ain't the word for this lifestyle
Loan sharking niggas, that don't deserve to live this lifestyle
Penitentiary chances on the daily
Shootouts every week, shit deep, God saved me
Going to war for the same niggas that betrayed me
Attutude real rude, fuck you pay me
In
Louisiana where the streets ain't gravy
Yeah, I'll lay down anybody just to live like Baby
Lord knows, these bitch niggas couldn't live my cold lifestyle
If you really knew Boosie boo, then you would run right now
Sick of all of these niggas saying that they gangsters
We don't rap beef like y'all rap beef, believe me, we spank ya
Sickest clique ever did it, we don't talk shit
How I live, a gun a part of my outfit
Take a pick, replace the six with the soda
It's a front so if the nigga complain, game over
Y'all live a rap lifestyle, mine colder
One of the few you could believe what they told you
All day stalking, we click clacking
Studying niggas moves it's cool, send a bitch at 'em
F.N rip a nigga til' holla'
Crime scene lost cause they thinking it's a choppa
Real homework and I ain't talking 'bout a scholar
Jump out sick, when I'm worth a million dollars
Living like this, then you got a million problems
In and out of courts, beefin' with your baby momma's
You want beef? Then that beef shit we got it
Whole clique murder ones, but we walk cause we solid
Lord knows, these bitch niggas couldn't live my cold lifestyle
If you really knew Boosie boo, then you would run right now
Sick of all of these niggas saying that they gangsters
We don't rap beef like y'all rap beef, believe me, we spank ya
Making niggas pay draft, this is real talk
Wink my eye, have you gone
A real boss
Thugging hard in Angola, on that real walk
Every nigga I done beefed wit had a big heart
Evil, the same place I see ya I leave ya
Going in niggas pockets, on GP 
Hit the club after I bleed you to tease you
Everybody strapped to the max, even Nita
Shit, taking niggas chains off they neck
Want it back? Then I gotta get a check
On Plank Road and they rip out the vet
Glock on the dresser everytime I have sex
Swerving down niggas block, vest up
Auntie telling me to change cause I'm living messed up 
Fuck rain, this is thunder mane
Director stole my script for the Hunger Games 
Lord knows, these bitch niggas couldn't live my cold lifestyle
If you really knew Boosie boo, then you would run right now
Sick of all of these niggas saying that they gangsters

I was thuggin' on the corner with my niggas, came from nothin'
Fuck these bitches, I don't trust 'em, I'm a dog, fuck her cousin
They like, "Goddamn Bibby why you still on that block shit?"
Get you shot quick 'round them niggas I don't rock with
I seen niggas turned Christian when they feel that hot shit
Thought you was a savage, now you on that Lord watch shit
Give a fuck if you box well, I got hot shells

Pistol whip your kids, I'm a demon, I'ma rot in Hell
Do the time, I will not tell like I'm Vondell

Mama always told me that the streets ain't got no love for you
Niggas get in jam, start tellin' on their blood brother
Need the type of homies like Edai, do a dub for you
Niggas stand around, they ain't workin', they just bloodsuckers
Love my lil' brother cause he always keep it real with me
If it fall down, he gon' be right there to build with me
Right back in the field with me, robber, he gon' kill with me
And we get into it every week, but he still with me
And I'm eatin' steak now, but I'm with that beef shit
Fuck these old niggas, they can't tell me 'bout no street shit
Love the ones you starve with, them the ones you eat with

All these niggas 'round card crackin', we just call that broad trappin'
I was in the field with my youngins, where it's all action
I just play my part, goin' hard for the squad
If a nigga play with me, he gon' have to meet his god
And I'm still ridin' through the hood, grippin' on the steel
Give a fuck 'bout how you feel, they know why I kept it hard
Fuck the police and the serge'
If they ask me 'bout a murder, I just tell 'em I was blind
Like my last name was Charles
Talkin' way before hip-hop, pounds in a Ziploc
White Shawn and Marley doin' drills, got the strip hot
I was shootin' dice, tryna come up on a big knot
You was in the class crackin' jokes like you Chris Rock

Yeah, fuck it, let me pop my shit one time
Nobody got hit, spin the block again 
I done been too solid, something got to give 
Rockin' real diamonds before I got the deal
Through the grace of God, we got away, so now we gotta chill
They thought it was rap cap and I told ’em that I got a mil'
You can get whatever if you ask me, you ain't gotta steal
My lil’ woadie said he fightin' demons, feel like he gotta kill
And I just left the hood to catch a vibe and that shit give me chills
One hand on my steering wheel, other arm to work the blicky
I'ma be forever gang but smart enough to keep my distance
Product of the real trenches, that's why I wear a trench coat
Damn near fucked my life gamblin', bet it all on ten-to-four
Rap get slow, I'm sellin' loads, can't get caught with no skinny ho
Can’t get caught with no ho at all, bitch, don’t slam my door that hard
I pull up like, "Oh my Lawd," she gon' shop, she hold my card
Glock four-fifth my bodyguard, I sip syrup, no noddin’ off
If you know you owe me, better come and pay me, better not be a dollar short
I done took the game, put it in a lock, I ain't even try
Lookin' like a lick, tryna play slick, nigga, you'll die
Comin’ from the bricks, I ain't had shit, now the new Coupe 125
Yeah
Nobody got hit, spin the block again 
I done been too solid, something got to give 
Rockin' real diamonds before I got the deal
Through the grace of God, we got away, so now we gotta chill
Yeah
Do it for my family, my fans, fuck how niggas feel
Told 'em it was my turn, I'm guessing that time's here
Skeleton my Cartier, makin' sure my time pure
If you were not here when we was thuggin', you can't come 'round here
Hard work, my grind real, I'm dedicated to get this paper
He okay, he's been a hater, I don't know why he mad at me
I won't let the youngins take him off, and now he mad at me
He better be lucky that I ain't out here just bad rappin'
High speed, gettin' in low gear, streets taught me have no fear
I invested in the West, their niggas know I've sold my dope there
Pretty pussy, no hair, she don't like when I put it in my song
So I can't go there, but she know I like to go there
Nobody got hit, spin the block again 
I done been too solid, something got to give 
Rockin' real diamonds before I got the deal
Through the grace of God, we got away, so now we gotta chill
They thought it was rap cap and I told 'em that I got a mil'
You can get whatever if you ask me, you ain't gotta steal
My lil' woadie said he fightin' demons, feel like he gotta kill
And I just left the hood to catch a vibe and that shit give me chills
What's happenin', Chi Chi?Big Bucks stacking money to the ceiling
Ask me what I need, bitch I need me a million
I know that it's coming man I got this little feeling
Buy a couple buildings, open up a business
Donate a couple thousand to the children
Y'all some broke boys need to go out and fix it
You pull up on 6's, stunt for the bitches
I pull up in a foreign, all these hoes going
I'm the man and they know it
I ain't gotta show shit or hit the club and throw shit
All these fucking haters make it hard to stay focused
WhiteShawn got it, if I holler, he gon' blow it
No Limit all these niggas know we
Steady rolling blunts until a nigga O.D
Keep acting blind, in a year they're going to see
Nigga how I ain't the man, and your bitch want me
I don't get it, black card, No Limit
Niggas steady talking money but ain't trying to go get it
No gimmicks motherfucker, this the real me
Even a paralysed nigga gotta feel me
Got a couple dollars but a nigga still cheap
Opps sending shots, pussy niggas try to kill me
There's too many niggas hating
Jumping on my dick because they see I'm money making
Acting like they real but I know they really faking
See me out in public, wonder why I never say shit
Lil Bibby man I rep my turf
I swear to fucking god I'm the hottest on earth
Got a couple youngins that'll put you on a shirt
And I love my little niggas because they always shoot first
Headshots, slam jam, we don't play around
The opps hear that gun sound when we come around
Catch a pussy nigga lacking, then gun him down
I run to town, tell my plug to bring another pound
Cause I be getting shit off
Lil Bibby, I'm a motherfucking boss
Like Ross, Go in the store, and buy whatever, don't give a fuck what it costs
If I'm the underdog, get ready for an upset
Got these haters upset because me and broski up next
I just ball hard, trap money, fuck checks
Couple tracks kill, I'm the only suspect
I just plead guilty, because y'all be hearing me
Somebody call the doctor, tell him to put some fear in me
I'm so east side, I be where the killers be
Headshot damage you physically and mentally
I don't think they get that
They're stealing bars, I'm like "Can I have my shit back"
Where the licks at, hit it then I split thatSaid I gotta keep my head above water
I been goin' hard gotta go a lil harder
I been thinking smart gotta think a lil smarter
All I know is hustle, get that shit regardless
Said I gotta keep my head above water
Catch me in the kitchen I be whippin' with the water
Family over niggas, blood thicker than water
All I know is hustle, get that shit regardless
Real hustla, I'mma get that shit regardless
I will not starve bitch, work hard; my palms itch
I seen some garbage that fucked up my conscience
Niggas they talk shit but these niggas harmless
Im fresh up out that field, I swear this shit is real
Run up in the bank like Bump for the bills
Remember as a kid wasn't shit up in the fridge
Rob you for your ends I don't regret the shit I did
Made it out that struggle
Blame it on the hustle
Bet it all and doubled
Don't fuck with me then fuck you
Nigga, I don't trust you
Mama, girl, I love you
RIP my soldiers man I swear I do this for you
In the kitchen I'm a chemist with the water I be whippin'
And these youngins they be snitchin'
If you start it Ima finish
Went hard from the begginin'

I'm tryna make a killin'
These hustlas gotta feel it
Hustlin's in my blood, money, cars, drugs

Boh, boh, boh, bohDon't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Yeah
Clothes busted, nose dusty, watch the older bros hustlin'
Started off wrong, but you couldn't tell me I ain't know nothin'
All I ever want was to put on and give my folks somethin'
Knockin' on my sister window, comin' in at 4 somethin'
Mama trippin' 'bout the way I'm livin' and how my hoes comin' 
Caught the next-door neighbor slippin', we slimed him, left his nose runnin' 
Knowin' I can't lie, so when she asked me, I  make no comment
Terrorizin', thuggin', doin' dumb shit, makin' no money
It was time for me to go up, got a pack and made it blow up
Went into that corner store until I got it all
Know I skipped a couple parts, but I can't never tell 'em all
But the moral of the story, I got it all out the mud
The way karma make me feel, I swear I think I'm in love
Been fuckin' strippers since I was lil', fell in love with the club
Bruh gave me everything I need, knew what to say to the plug
I got my hands on a few mil', but shit, it still ain't enough
It's like my life is like a dream, but I'm still here when I wake
I'm gon' get everything I need, I'll do whatever it take
I caught a case, ran, got away, I should've jumped in the lake
I thought about it the other day when I slid through in the Wraith
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Bad bitch, we both young
They say that I'm cheatin' and we both dumb
But Baby got her wrist hittin', both arms
G-Wagen and Range Rover, both of 'em
If we love forever, you get new homes
I just wish that other **** could move on
She proud to be rockin' that new two-tone
My life goin' good, why would I do wrong?
I'm livin' my best just like Lil Duval
I didn't get the message, and it's screw y'all
I don't want no issues, can't be beefin' with my family
I don't want no problems, just make sure my kids can count and read
And it ain't no pressure 'bout the money, I won't even see it
It's bigger, it's the principle, I hope one day that you can see
We got a whole seed to raise, it's bigger than you and me
How I'm not gon' do that? I spend millions on my jewelry
The only reason I'm mentionin' it is 'cause I'm tired of this foolery
I'm just emptying my thoughts, I can't keep 'em in a box
Ain't no hard feelings at all, I want everyone to ball
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
I said I don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explainCook that shit up, Quay

Verse 1:

Underground music nigga I don't wanna make it

My cousin told me stop lettin' shit slide
Alotta young niggas run around gettin' high
Playin' with my safety man that's how you fuckin' die
Some people let you run, some people let you hide
I'm the type of guy that'll send you to the grave
I stay positive, but these niggas still hatin'
Don't run in my house cause I'll blow yo fuckin' brain
Out yo fuckin' ass cause you robbin' for that cash
Don't make excuses, you don't wanna do this
I stay flexin' new shit, errrythang new shit
Only o.g.'s I fuck with when I do shit
Young niggas die cause they don't understand
Don't fuck with a man that's been fucked over
Everybody know I got a chip on my shoulder
A boulder on my back and I feel like I'm in the 'Nolia
Bitches really love me, niggas really hate that
Have yo opinion, just don't fuckin' touch me
Goldhouse hustla only nigga with the house

I want everything, money, white flame, I'm down for whatever
You bring that shit to me, I'm bringin' that shit right back you bitchDon't want the world to see me
Don't think that they'd understand
Everything's meant to be broken
Want you to know who I am
My lifetime came from struggle
All I've seen is what I follow
My skin color, automatic transaction
I'm already classified, no second chance
Taught to feel nappy hair, little grade
Why can't I sag when it's just a style
Little beard, black hoodie, and I'm all good
People judge before they even know me
Stare at me, don't know I'm lonely
Outside's from these stares from police
And I get the bad rep because another man
That just looks like me
Think life's a movie like Spike Lee, too cool like Ice T
Yeah, I move with Life's Peace
And he move with the gun piece
So there's no peace
I gotta go to the hood, all I see is
Divided, the freshest schizophrenics
Men pimping women, people losing vision
Given choices before she started living
I hate myself
I see myself in the mirror, but I don't see nothing
If you understand what I'm seeing please tell me something
When you black, the media make you wonder why
I just need my history, because I hate myself
It makes me sad to see pimping
Like I'm at a battle with my surroundings
Everybody do it, but not really
And I couldn't imagine my momma
Universal knowledge is karma
I see young girls hanging off the corner
And they searching for love in the wrong space
Gave her mind to a pimp, now he's changing faces
Sometimes I just wish I could trade places
I hate myself for being taught the rules of the hood
Which don't matter, no respect and no love
Ain't got jail for the real thugs
And I'm sorry to all the innocent in prison
You get a second chance when you free or in heaven
I promise if you really love and you watch your steps
Respect everybody, man you will get blessed
Get your point across without violence
The black dying by the gun, I'm tired of crying
I hate myself
For real man, this been in my heart for a long time
And if you understand, please tell me something
When you black, the media make you wonder why
I'm ready to give up my old thoughts
I'mma move past what I saw
I'mma do what I want and be happy
I'm not gon' rob or kill to survive
Everything I've seen was a lie
I'm not ready to die, I love myself
I said, everything that I've seen was a lie
I'm not ready to die, I love myself
Break that mental
You know we are free now man
Break that, uh, mental blockage
Don't think too hard, free your mindSalute to the motherfucking President

Shout-outs to Hillary Clinton
You 'bout to win that president shit
For me you gonna be president soon, baby
Swag! Swag! Swag! Cut! Knife!
White House! White House!I found peace and comfort
In sharing our existence
I found satisfaction
Just knowing you were listening
I found something special
I tried to make it last
Yet my head hurt me
It pushed into the past
I tried to plead my sorry
But I can not express
The way this got me feeling
I had to just digress
I don't wanna be here no more
I'm trapped in my head
I'm trapped in my thoughts
I just wanna be free
I won't have to run away
I won't have to see your face
I won't have to lead astray
I won't have to find my place
I won't have to feel your skin
I won't have a life to live
I won't have to be afraid
I don't need to be okay
Everything seems to go fast
Yet here I am, still in the past
Trying to find just something more
Than what I had with you before…of chance to you, to him is one of real skill
So glad to meet you, Angeles
Picking up the ticket shows there's money to be made
Go on and lose the gamble that's the history of the trade
Did you add up all the cards left to play to zero
And sign up with evil, Angeles
Don't start me trying now uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
‘Cause I’m all over it, Angeles
I could make you satisfied in everything you do
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
And be forever with my broken arms around you
No one's gonna fool around with us
No one's gonna fool around with us
So glad to meet you, Angeles
I’m just doing what I’m doing, I’ve been moving lately
I’m just trying to live my life, but this shit is crazy
And everybody think I’m good and I’m fantastic
Even though I’m in the game, bitch I’m not a rapper
Seen it’s real life when they killed the childhood friend
The funeral looked like a middle school reunion
Rewind the tape, man I swear they couldn’t do this
Now I live paranoid Confucius
Think about the day that I’m gonna stop breathing
Anything could happen please don’t misread it
Tornado watch in Orange Country I can see it
The world coming to an end I really can’t believe it
Can’t nobody hear my cry when I’m in the zone
Don’t nobody give a fuck, bitch I’m all alone
And the people, man they really don’t give a shit
They’ll leave you on your dick and they’ll fuck your bitch
Why in school they didn’t teach about the taxes?
In the real world man it’s all about taxes
All about TV and living above average
Where the fuck you staying, all about your status
What the fuck you drive to the size of your mattress
How big your chain and the girls that you smashing
How much you work plus the time you relaxing
Time spent in jail and on the street savage
Mixed with the robbers, the stress, and the addicts
Mixed with the greed and the guns and the havoc
Mixed with the weed and the pills and the acid
Killing off my people and the media is laughing
Learn about the past but the present is what’s happening
Probation, slavery, pissing for the master
The cops is a gang and they really beat your ass
And the courts is the mob and it’s ran by the cash
I look good on the outside
But messed up in the inside
And everybody got a gun now
I guess I’m ready to die let me fly
I really feel like I might not get married
I don’t trust myself so I trust her barely
And I’m not a dog and I’m not a cheetah
But the girls is bending over screaming Lil Beezy
And they don’t tell you that they run around with diseases
Fuck the wrong one, catch AIDS, can’t believe it
Russian roulette everyone watched and cheated
Your main girl high in tax and she fucking Regis
Who wants a million? Most gold diggers do
Say one thing and think another, man they really do
Anything that help you go to hell with the parachute
They really just chirping, talking back like the parrots do
I’m really trying to spit real life like the parents do
Ask bout Lil B and they tell you that I spit the truth
A lot of people don’t understand what I do
And when the world ends just play this song when it’s throughUh
All hail king Bibby

Lil B
The age of information
I grew up and never blew up
I'm knowin' one day I'll be the big dog
Colombian cocaine white
With lavish women surrounding me and in my carriage
The only time I call a chick now is Bloody Mary
It's in the mirror
I'm feelin' like I'm a champion, lookin' like I'm a mannequin
Cannabis residue is on my seat from breaking down again
I'm on computers
Profusely
Searching on the internet for answers, given to me
It's like I'm married, I'm watching the the bloggers heavily
TV is ran by money, how am I supposed to be?
The truth is near me, I can hear it and I can feel it
But are we dumbing down for technology and the cost of living?
I just forget it, continually smoking heavily
Thinkin' about the melody
Thinkin' of what's ahead of me
We comin' further than ever to live in space and
Somebody got the weapon that's controlling the human race
It's the age of information, the age of information
This is the age of information
Everything is on the Internet now
Data
Yes
My desktop is made to sedate me
Thinkin' illogically
On my laptop for hours like I'm in college, B
Honestly asking Google 'bout things that I should learn about
Can't even get lost in the navi
Inside, cell-phone overtaking
Got a car so never walkin'
They took away places where it's only the forest
I'm jogging in peace
I got my iPod slappin' these beats
I'm on a mission to find peace and precision
The cost of living is taxes and jail time without time to find your passion
I'm askin' the older people how you make it to your status
They laugh, because they see reflection while I'm askin' questions
And the best gift is to listen
Learn math to count your blessings
Used to catch a bus on AC transit, dark nights
Look like 20/20 lens-out of focus
Waitin' outside of stores
Askin' elders to buy Swishers and they come back with fifty cents
Now I'm buyin' liquor
MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter
Youtube often showing porno off to the average human being
I'm watchin' people in Japan naked G's from overseas
Chatroulette
I used to be on the corner where it's drug roulette
So pick, obviously
The information like art, it hurt the race
Because we judge before we classify
It's like a cage, human race has failed
Even though we in space we still hate ourselves
The age of information is hell
When I said that information has hurt the race
This age of information has hurt the race, and you know why
Because all we do is judge
All the movies, all the Internet, all we do is classify people
Now I feel the Internet has ruined the human race
Even though, you know, we can fly, and cars and technology has gotten better
I feel the the human race is not progressed as much as we should be
How come the human race isn't progressing as fast as technology has
Yeah, we gonna be staying on the moon
But there's still gonna be racists
So, in the end, are we really winning -- these nuclear bombs, nuclear war
What's going on
This is Lil B, The Age of Information 2010

I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
I used to want a coupé and a thick bitch
Now all I see is dead presis, got a sixth sense
Every day I'm on the block I'm thinking, this' it
My nigga outta town showed me how to flip bricks
He said, "Fuck this rap shit, this how you get rich"
They watchin' for that dirty money, I can't spend shit
I gotta feed the fam, I came up with a plan
I need some extra hands to help me move all these grams, for real
They see a young nigga stuntin', now they want you killed
Gotta watch out for these youngins tryna pay they bills

Niggas kept hatin', but I had to grind through it
Bitch, I define music
I ain't quit when shit got hectic
I did it on my own, niggas gotta respect it
And this shit for my young niggas, in the hood with no father
The shit I seen in these streets encouraged me to go harder
And this shit is off the top, my phone died, I got no charger
Keep it real with your self, I promise you, you'll go farther, eh
And these niggas didn't believe me
But now the whole world need me

Freedom of the people gets the evil demon annoyed
Believe in you and me and we can bring the peace and the joy
So I refuse to further fall down deep in this void
Of political bullshit
The drama that they brought
And we were dragged into it helpless
And they thought
That they could just use us as pawns or puppets
Fuck the system, I was born above it
I'm the son of God
Raise an army by myself
And we fight for education, employment and public health
Ain't talking about violence, I'm talking 'bout the mindset
Talking 'bout the prospect of a sign of a progress
I have a dream like Martin Luther
Imagine Nepalese on the top of the world, uhh
Do it together, 'cause it's our future
Build a better place for the boys and the girls, uh
Give 'em a hope, instead of killin' they dreams
A reason to laugh, instead of reason to scream
Give 'em what they need to get whatever they want
And make 'em proud of the place that they come from
Yeah, भन्छन सबै कुरा सोच बाट सुरु
सोच्छु सोच ले सोच माथी को सोच मा म पुगु
सोच भन्दा माथी के? सोच एक फेर
सोच्दा सोच्दै कतै जीवन जाने होकि खेर
तर त्यो पनि त एउटा जाबो सोचै त हो
सोचै सोचले पिरोल्ला कल्ले सोचेको थियो?
Uniq Poet दाइको आजकल खुस्केकै हो
सोच्न पैसा लाग्दैन भाइ, सोचेर बोल
दिन्छु गितबाट ज्ञान म, दिदैनस ध्यान त
सहि प्रश्न सोधे पो पाउछस गतिलो answer
अहिले आइज एकछिन मेरो सोच को तरंग संग रम्न
अनि भन्न, ए बा दाजु कडा!
दिमाग भित्र झाक देख्छस सात लोकको कथा
अ, नशा हो नशा मा डुबिराछु
खै कता हो कता तर पुगिराछु
त्यो काल्पनिक गन्तब्य मेरो आफ्नो छुट्टै सत्य लक्ष्य भन्दा धेरै पर
तर नजिकको सबसे, अडकेको जस्तो लाग्छ अनि उम्किन खोज्छु
एउटा बाटो उम्के पनि फेरि अर्को बारे सोच्छु
एउटा पिंजडा को सुगा म
म लुक्ने एउटा कुना छ 
त्यो कुनाभित्र गुम्सेपनी 
छर्न खोज्छु आफ्नो सुवास
Yeah  म छर्न खोज्छु आफ्नो सुवास

Buddha was born in Nepal को घमण्ड बोक्ने छन सय
हजार, लाख, करोड, हतार भाछ हो?
विदेशको देखासिखिले झन अन्धकार बढ्यो
अब भन्लास र्याप हान्छस बाहिरकै त हो
देख्दैनस दाइले यहाँ आफ्नै पाराले गरेको
बाल छैन के बिक्छ मलाई, बाल के छ trending
But I'm feeling like a God with the message that I'm sending
It's simple, I'm an old soul no wrinkles
I goes deep, deeper than Preeti Zinta को डिमपल
These rappers Microsoft
Throw 'em out the window
I'm barely gettin' started this ain't even a intro
Indo, umm, no
I don't really smoke it
गाजा नतान्ने र्यापर but my bars be the dopest
And I'm focused like a telescope is to show this light wherever necessary
U-N-I-Q so legendary
मलाई बाल, मलाई बाल
हरेक साल, नयाँ style
You like the old shit, but my new shit झन बब्बाल
I never knew much
I said I never knew much
But the fact that life's a bitch so I gotta get my revenue up
That bitch like money, she like cars
She want yours, she don't like ours
So we gotta take what you got
And show that bitch who the fuck we are
Who the fuck am I, a superstar?
No, I'm a fucking galaxy
Better yet, a universe inter-galactic majesty
Remember me 'til you die
Yell my name in front of heaven if you wanna step inside
No, I am not the one that you should try
तेरो पुजिवादी सोचलाई मुजि दलिदिए भाइ 
Die with your dreams, nobody gonna cry
And I'm sorry motherfucker if I'm fucking up your vibe
Ayy, if I'm fuckin' up your vibe
Let me get back
Let me get back, please
No, no, no, no
Yeah, a'ight, a'ight
Matter of fact, that's exactly what I wanted to
I don't give a fuck, how you feel what you gonna do?
Done with your bullshit
I'ma slam the door up
तेरो सपनामा बुट्टा भर्दै बस्न जन्म्या होर?

Good luck with your life
Now get out of my way
Here's some money for your wife

Working with the best in the game, Rohit Shakya and such
O M G, Bluesss भाई, we up in this bitch hoe, Hip-Hop is alive again
You didn't know
Lil Buddha told me hop on the mic
And so I did
सबै सपना नै हो, that's exactly how we live motherfucker
Ayy, ayy, this is nothing new to us it's easy
Kicking something super cool and breezy
They say that I'm a genius
And y'all rookies in the scene
Nepalese style rock a rupee and a dream
When I rap I got people shook like an earthquake erupted
Declare it to the world that I'm not to be fucked with
How hot can this fuck get?
Yo, how could we top this?
Impossible like me tryna' come out on top on a drug test
I'm the hottest one to ever make it out of this fuck fest
Been a player, high with the Himalayan freshness
You and I are different, I'm another breed
I'm a another level mother laid some other type of seed
I'm infected with the mental kind disease, got love
They listen close whenever I speak, haha
But I ain't  got no message brother I'm just doing me
I guess they like how I flow with ease
Peace

Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar
Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problems
We ain't got no money problems, we ain't got no money problems
I told 'em put me in the game coach, I'm a starter
And if she actin' like she need me I'ma starve her
Remember days ridin' on MARTA
But now we flyin' private jets to different cities
And I keep a bad bitch with me
Two chains everywhere like Tity, I done growed up
Bad bitches askin' where the weed, it's time to roll up
They can't get to me because I'm up right now
They can't get to me because I'm up
Flyer than a motherfuckin' pilot
We been on the jets, we fly private
I just touched down in L.A. today, in New York tomorrow
Then I gotta go to Texas, I'll be back tomorrow
Ever since I was a youngin' I been chasin' every dollar
Count up them blue hundreds, we ain't got no money problemsJust for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Lil B, Based God
King of rap, I can bet my money on that
Can't face the facts that a young guy killin' shit
Give me another shot and I'mma come with my mask on
Seen a lot of growth since I came with the Vans song
Now it's '09 and I'm runnin' with the Based God
Fire in my eyes, mix my soul with the napalm
Mix and master, all I need is dro and one mic
One pad, one pen, iPod, dim lights
Feelin' like a plane when it's up and it's in flight
Dressing everyday like I'm dead with the pinstripe
This a few things that show that I'm the rawest
Spend the cash everyday so I'm ballin like Spalding
Want beef, like six I’ll have you baldin' like Baldwin
Your favorite rapper out, I'mma lay 'em in a coffin
No talkin' when I'm talkin', cause it's legend, pay attention
Only time I sat in class was when I'm serving a detention
I fuck with Soulja Boy, get money nigga
Everytime I see rappers, all I'm thinking, I'm a get him
In the booth or in the streets, I'm known to tear and rip 'em
15 and 16, eyes breaking down the system
Nobody can tell me nothing, I was livin off my system
Head fucked up, I thought it would be cool to go to prison
Watching Hot Boyz on BET, getting all these women
So I got my gold grill because I'm thugged out with 'em
B-Town, Waterfront I put on for my city
We done did it for 6 years, just reached 20
A lot of dudes I grew up with didn't see 20
Everytime I have a birthday, I'm thinking God love me
Everytime I hit the beat, man I do it for my Mom
Workin' hard everyday I'mma make it where it's mine
I'mma hustle all the time, like Lil' Wayne do
If you' ever up against me, you get ate like grapefruit
My first reaction was like, just chill and stay cool
The rap game is slow and it just ain't cool
Always jockin all my style and it just ain't you
Only time I feel you, is if a based boy do
Because I'm a rap god and a based boy too
I can listen to the hate and put the volume on mute
So the only thing I hear is the horses in the coupe
And when the roof go down it reminds me of my chick
Getting money off the floor because "I'm trapping like a bitch"
Like Gucci Mane said but it's rich nigga clique
And my name is Lil B, you can call me king of rap
I done did a few things and I'm never goin back
Mirror mirror on the wall, shit, I'm askin who the man is
Lil B for Lil Boss I'm prayin to my canvas
I deserve the crown because I'm speakin for the masses
And I'm into weed, I'm gettin chiefy like Kansas
Words to the wise, you should fear the competition
Because I'm the only vet that's a Based God spittin
And you ain't in the game until you make a thousand songs
And you dyin' for this rap, because it's the only thing you love
Birth of Rap
Birth of RapToasty

This what I been grindin' as a kid for
If it ain't money, nigga, what you live for?
Riding in a Range, look in my eyes, you see the pain
Having convos with my granny, she just tryna keep me sane
She told me since a youngin' you and them boys weren't the same
I can tell by your actions you was in another lane
And I'm on the same stuff, I can never change up
Niggas telling names, huh? That'll get you flamed up
Riding in the Benz, I've been in the zone
Catch Bibby all alone, now I'm gripping on the chrome
Niggas hit my phone, tryna cop a zone
Nigga must be working, man what type of shit he on?
I can tell by how he talking, that nigga done lost it
Tryna put a case on me, you know that that's gon' cost him
 x2
Nigga what you live for?
Niggas taking risks for the money, doing years for it
Gotta feed them kids boy
Grinding so hard, I don't do it for myself
Long as the fam straight, who gives a fuck about my health?
Look, weighing up them grams, that's how I learned mathematics
Stunting for these hoes, these youngnins hustle ass backwards
Them old heads didn't give them the game
These boys lost, man, that shit is a shame
And when them boys rolled up, I seen niggas froze up
These the same niggas, they be acting like they so tough
Boy, you need to stop it
That act, you need to drop it
Niggas in the streets know I'm all about a profit, huh

Cause I don't need nobody's help
Said I don't need nobody's
 x2Fuck the rap game
It's that death of the rap game
Fuck the world

You drive cars, you fuckin' fag, I been gassin'
In my eyes is blood, sweat and pain, cuz
It's a shame that they don't know my name, Blood
Lil B: I blow trees in all seasons
Think I'm slippin? Find out! For no reason
Met pain, I met God, I met death

Leave his head split and no Cochran to back him
Don't you niggas wish I'd fall off the Big League?
At my lowest point, sacrifice to make bread
XMR - call your bitch and get head

Bigger than just a race, no card, just a race
No smile, fix your face, we all live in this place
Tryna make peace, with the police
I'm not on probation, so why you out askin' me?
This is not just about black, or wasn't about black
When we talk about that, you wonder why I talk back
My English not perfect, I'm not the best at school
But understand I'm—
I love life's rules
Homeless people will even give me money, I'm too real for the game
Reflection of the fame
I got cash, I hide all the pain

Black people not showed in the media
I was told that you gotta afro, that you gotta big nose
That your lips are too big, you're talkin' low
My people understand, so why you don't know?
It's just communication
If we all sat down and got past the revelations
The future of the people
Advancement, tryna take chances, the media
Propaganda, it slandered the black beauty
I'm not stupid, I see it everyday
They got shows like Jailbreak but won't help you get straight
I'm tryna see black on more magazines
On the streets, the hoods that you're claimin'
Never been racist so I understand if you wanted, try to change places
I've seen the other side and I know that's amazin'
Life is amazin'
They want you to work to enslave you
They try to trick you to think they made you
Y'all got a voice, stand up against violence
If it's close to your home, stand up against rape
No means no, clean up the streets, ya feel me?
And stop that beef
Hands up for peace on the streets

Que locura es esta situación libre de impuestos
Ernesto me ha dicho que apesto, ¡¿que yo apesto?!
Don't fuck with me o te aturullo de un gesto
El tempo es presto, y no me paro en el Banesto
Ain't got no cash, no flash, cocinando spaghetti al pesto
Rectifico, admito ser tu mito
Fito y fitipollas son un grupo de ladrones de joyas
Que beben de la Bezoya, y tú, ahora, puedes beber de mi po...
¿Ya estamos aquí en Patxingar diciendo tonterías?
Tonterías no, cuida'o, son cosas muy serias:
Sin mí, este país se quedaría sin reina
Sin herramientas para la histeria, sin feria; Comando Nigeria
Represento a Juanber cuando digo que amo a Flanders
Se hacen ver croquetas cuando rezas a la virgen
I want all of you to make 'em  disappear, like Harbel Dixen
¿Pero qúe me dice'? Anda, corre, vete a por lombrice'
Ja, ja ,ja, ja, ja, no hace gracia, yo lo sé
¿Tú lo sabes?, ¿él lo sabe?, ¿quién lo sabe, Don Daniel? Nah
Don Guillempleado del hogar del jubliado
El cabrón se come al día tres huesitos, cinco helados
¿Porros? Varios, ¿Feo? Claro
¿Ha intentado buscar trabajo? ¡Y un carajo!
He doesn't even know what working is, what he could be
Si sale de su casa le entran ardores anales
Analiza esto que he escrito, ahí lo lleváis, chavales
Chavale'
A estudiar...Yeah
I'mma be one of the greatest I can feel it in my veins
People sell they soul just to try to get a name
Lost homies to the streets, had to charge it to the game
Seem like everybody changed, I guess that's the price of fame
But I knew you motherfuckers was gonna come right back
I sit back, relax, while I count these stacks
Bibby show up to your city, I need 10k flat

What the fuck can a damn high school teach me?
Man this rap shit got me set up, now I gotta keep my head up
I sit back and think, this weight on my shoulders
I might need a shrink, living drug free, man I might need a drink
Say I'm finna cop a Jesus piece cause niggas, they ain't seein' me
Critics, they critiquin' me, love when they don't believe in me
This real life, real facts, this ain't rap

Wish somebody would have warned me, I'd have quit this shit
Sometimes I wish I never did this
You know what man? Forget this shit
Cause sometimes I be thinkin' bout offin' myself
It's no one that I could trust, so I talk to myself
I understand this shit, that's how it feel to be the man and shit
A lot of niggas want this life, I swear they couldn't handle it
I stay in the newest shit like a mannequin

 Welcome to Hell
I'm the Devil
I've taken over Lil B's soul
I'mma bring the pain to you
This is not a game but it's...
Something different when you rising with elegance
There's fire in my eyes and death is on my breath
I cook in Hell's kitchen, so you should watch your step
I'm burning every day, my soul, there's nothing left
Everything I say is contrary to belief
And saying something deep, my speech is rap poison
I choose fake cause I can never stop the bad voices
Yes I made choices, I'd rather take the easy route
That ended up with me killing myself
I'm reincarnated with the based demigods
I took B's soul, his family was surprised
I looked them in his eyes, I can see through disguise
I took him down to Hell, he was wearing suit and tie
He begged for his life, but his life is mine now
I'm Satan, I make deals and death wishes
I hate Based God, want to put him on the guestlist
Give him first class trip to underworld, ghost town
Black stab city, you can see when no one's around
Really want to keep you blind, watch you sleep underground
No more rap songs and no based freestyles
I really can't breathe cause I'm turning to a beast now
Momma said if I want to be the best it's hard work
I chose to live reckless... And now I'm under dirt
But it's Hell on Earth with these presidents and new bombs
War every day, Wall Street scams, our jam
Everyone so they can feel my pain cause I fucked up
Have you ever messed up to the point... Now you fucked up
Lost your own life to yourself, can't believe this
Devil took my soul, I don't believe I couldn't see this
Everybody think cause you alive you couldn't be this
I'm waiting for a soul and I'll see if I can seize it
Pray to the mob boss, pray to the X-Men
I'll see you in hell if you're living with regrets, man
Best words to you, you should learn from the best men
Don't follow the next man, I'm looking for some best friends
Don't nobody care if you're doing what you love, if
You doing what you love, then
Stay away from us...
Stay away from happiness cause loneliness is here
You roaming with the Based God I'm bound to interfere
I'm the Devil
Welcome to Hell...
Hell on Earth
I'm taking over
The DevilYes
Sometimes I feel like giving up
It's that real hip hop
I sell dope everyday just to make a cut
Police in the hood say, "Try your luck,"
Metaphor to my life
I'm not grinding enough
I feel like giving up
Man, there's time in my life I feel like giving up
All this hate that I hear
Man I heard enough
Mom told that I need to go get a job
Drug dealer in the hood tryna get me to rob
I really feel like the pressure of money
People live five cars, big houses
That ain't me
I'm tryna figure out how I'm goin' eat
I was shopping Whole Foods
But that shit ain't cheap
So I'm buying cheeseburgers four times a week
Drinking Hennessy right before I sleep
People don't understand cause I don't tell no one
Sometimes I really feel like getting a gun
We was born into a gang
Old rules, old news
Written the books people think we supposed to
I ain't goin' lie, don't compare me to those dudes
Who say the rap game, everybody eating they head
If you ain't gotta cut then it's try your luck
Sometimes I really wonder if my time is up
Cool people die for the strangest things
I understand the game and I play for free
My head hurt, walking around all this damn debris
I feel like sitting back and just pushing weed
The feds on my back wanna catch the cat
I need green eggs and ham, bitch,
And a sandwich
The world gone
The shit bigger
It's my family, some people say I'm insane
Albert Eistein
Way too blessed with the hearing and hindsight
It's way more than rap
It's the pain
Niggas see it, put em' to shame
And you see me cry, but I never complain
I'll build your house or I'll a drive plane
Niggas come in my house
You gotta respect the game
The gun make you feel like the Jetsons came
Oakland, what it do?
Berkley, what it do?
Richmond, what it do?
I'm still depressed
And I drive Bentley coups
Still in the hood
With the 9s in the roof, you feel me?
I ain't goin' lie
Niggas lying, I'm the truth
Fuck what you heard, I'mma tell you what I know
This that word from God, I'mma tell you from my soul
If I lied everyday than I wouldn't grow
I'm not no pimp
I'm not no corporate ass ho
That pimp with a suit and a mask on
Them fake motherfuckers wanna lay on the asphalt
But nonviolence is the best protest
Niggas, fuck your guns and fuck your vest
If you love Lil B than I love you to death
Niggas, life good
Motherfucker I'm stressed
I'mma turn that stress into some motherfucking pressure
Pressure make diamonds,
Lay em' on the dresser
Shout out to Casey, don't go back to jail
You say,"Fuck the police," but the police love you
They wear a suit and they looking for your suit
I love earth and I'm happy
Pray we all survive, you feel me?
Most people in the hood only talk with knives
Short tempers and them bullshit lies
Putting kids through hell
I don't respect those guys, you feel me?
Suckers at the top, haters at the bottom
And you goin' stay right there
I don't lie nigga, I stay right here
We won't give up
We won't give up
We won't give up
We goin' make it
We won't give up
We won't give up
We won't give up
We goin' make it
We won't give up
We won't give up
We won't give up
Lil B, you goin' make it
I sell dope everyday just to make a cut
Police in the hood say, "Try your luck,"
Metaphor to my life
I'm not grinding enough
I feel like giving up
I sell dope everyday just to make a cut
Police in the hood say, "Try your luck,"
Metaphor to my life

I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?"
That's what makes me free. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result. Anything is possible. It is night on planet earth and I'm alive. And someday I'll be dead. Someday I'll just be bones in a box But right now, I'm, not. And anything is possibleIt's your boy Lil B, it's that new mixtape

Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier

Free James, my nigga, fighting thirty
When you out here in these streets, gotta watch out for these birdies
And I keep God with me so nobody else could hurt me
But I still get nervous, so I'm gripping on the thirty
You gotta feel this
I take you through the block like a field trip
One mistake, it cost your life, real quick
Where every young nigga wanna be real rich
Only thing they know how to do, rob and kill shit
I know it's fucked up, but I'm happy that I lucked up
Got my bucks up, all my niggas, what's up?
I grew up a fucking screw up
Got introduced to the game, that's when everything changed
Self-made, nobody taught me a thing
Buying all these chains, tryna get rid of the pain
Street life, I done that, I seen that
And this one for my city, man I love you, I mean that

Ooh child, things will get brighter

You know I got a lot of shit on my mind
Got a lot of things I just need to talk about
First off I want tell everybody I love them
And I just appreciate being alive
You feel me?
I bring you back to last year
No dollars bruh
Until we changed the game
The whole world followed us
A lot of people part of us
But they not who started us
They stealing money
Now acting like they charging us
It's not about the money
It's the attitude that's harming us
Had the team thinking I was leaving on the charter bus
What's this about the album?
Niggas is so foul
Saying "our management" 
But they don't manage shit 
Niggas left me in the park for five years
I got stabbed in my back
Man up, that shit's real
Niggas know that I love 'em to the end
And if you is my friend you gon' tell me what it is
I'm all ears and I keep my eyes open
Last time I fell asleep I left the game wide open
Last time I fell asleep I almost got my neck broken
Charge it to the hood
I might leave his face smoking
Lil B
What has happened to me?
Oh...
Sh...
Yes...
You know I'll just...
I'll never do it again
Bruh, a lot of niggas claiming they got trust issues
Man, if I smell a sucker I can't fuck with you
Every year a nigga switch up on you
Man he say he called my phone
He was never my homie
All of a sudden niggas start to think we're friends from Middle School
That's why I never spoke on you in my interviews
They say I'm crazy cause I'm fucked up, maybe
I been ran over, played with, left for crazy
I been locked in that courtroom, down in Oakland
Nigga scarred from YA
But he kept on rolling
We all sing the same tune
But I chose to wake up
Changed my whole mindset and I got my cake up
But I ain't change too much
Niggas still is leeches
Still got the same skin and I'm happy I'm breathing
And if I wronged you in my past
I'm sorry
I suffer inside and that's the worst thing for me
Lil B
Man, I got so many questions
Like I said
They ask
If I could do it again all over again, would I do it?
Yeah, I'd do it all over again
But do it way better
I love this life
Gotta do it for my uncles
You don't even know what's in my soul
They deserve the whole goal 
They wanted me to stop
But I gotta keep going
I ride through West Oakland
I'm near the Greyhound
I put the grapes down cause these niggas like me slipping
I stay with the Mac
It's sorta like I'm pimping
I can't speak on it
But I don't condone it
Live your own life and be happy for them moment
Just cause you got it don't mean you own it
Just cause you bought it don't mean that you flaunt it
We starving at the moment
Sitting in the office
Another damn referral, man I see this paper often
Fuck 'em if they don't understand my genius, bitch
I'll be Albert Einstein times a million, bitch
And I'm still saving people on a daily basis
Another reason why these bitch motherfuckers hating
It's Lil Boss
I'm Lil Boss
Lil Berkeley
Lil B
Lil Based God
Lil Based
Some motherfuckers even had the nerve to say Lil Bitch
Fuck 'em
Bitch Mob fi-yaaah
You feel me?Pues nada, gente, eh, aquí dejo lo que sería
Mi mayor creación hasta la fecha:
Justo un añito después de, del anterior
Y por supuesto dedicado a...
Al señor Guille, y al señor Juanito
¡Ayps!
Seguimos con los versos perversos demuestro a todos que ejerzo
De chico raro, con descaro, hijo de Amparo y de un tuerto
Mi tío es Berto, no Romero, no Tomillo
Ver todos los días al primo pillo, que pillaba frío y no se abriga
Le suena la barriga, ¿diga?
"Hello, I'm your belly, can you give me some comida?"
Mira, of course I can, y compro un caldo de Avecrem
Se creen ustedes que soy rico, rico el caldo, ¡Sabe bien!
¿Sabes qué más sabe bien? Jeje, exacto
Aunque parezca pintada por Goya, no es más que mi po-po-po
Poción traída de Troya, la han traído Luis, Bernardo, Ernesto
En esto que me da por ver el móvil; mensaje de texto
Resulta ser Felipe VI el remitente
"Lo siento, brother, tengo el casoncio lleno 'e gente"
No te rayes - le contesto - y, fuera de contexto, resto
Nueve menos dos son siete, increíble el gesto
Don Guillempleado, vetado, lo echaron del reservado
Se pira al prado y se corre mirando un cuadro doblado
Doblado él, no el cuadro, "¿Champú o gel?" Soy calvo
"Te ves muy bien, ¡Qué guapo!", ¿te pregunté?, ¡No, chato!
Sabes que Poncio Pilato
No se ha compra'o los zapatos
Viene descalzo el jabato
Con los pelos del puto Arrebato
Y ahora te tiro unas líneas sin dar muchos datos
Son cosas banales, no de literatos
La cosa es que vengo y me quedo pa' un rato
No miro el formato, te pongo el retrato
Me vienen dos culos mulatos
Dos culos bien grandes en un carromato
Culitos de marca, no culos baratos
Orondas las nalgas, bien anchos los anos
Los cubre una tela del tipo satén
La cosa es que huelen, y no huelen bien
Estamos hablando de anos hediondos
Estando en la calle producen asombro
Por sus dimensiones, por su basta peste
Subastan el fétido y étnico ambiente
"Qué asco, qué guarro", pa' guarra tu hermana
Se saca diez mocos por fin de semana
Y emana de aquí cierta sabiduría:
"Si el culo es rojizo, muy mono sería"
Sorprende desnudo en la charcutería
Mi abuelo Rogelio, con su brujería
Del Día salía un guía, prendía la party
Todo el mundo mano arriba and just move your body
Son las fiestas de mi pueblo, vente, Maribel
Se vino la Ana, se vino Susana, y la Magdalena también
Recién me enteré de que un toxicómano
Coma o no coma, se muere por verme
Me llaman la droga, panoja in my pants, rayitas de esencia
La demencia que es bélica y trágica, mágica
Juan Tamariz en la errática fálica de clamar pito y huevito, tal cual Maduro a final del jornal
¡Yeah!, Ja
Nada más que añadir, señores: Marca "Patxingar"
Y espero que no pase otro año hasta el siguiente...
¡Con Dios!SauceDad69

Twenty days, a hundred bands, I did that
You come from the jungle, I can dig that
You can't tell me nothin' 'bout the struggle
Man these streets I'm really in 'em, every day I had to live that
Hopin' that they never find us
Promise they gon' try to hide us
But fuck 'em, I'm buckin', they gon' have to do they job

I respect women everyday and night
If you don't respect women, were gonna have a fight
Turn these bitches on, like some Christmas lights
I only fuck her if her vagina is tight
Take her out to dinner and I wear a fancy suit
Take her out to dinner, while I'm ridding on a moose
Take her to my house and fuck her in the caboose
My jizz on her neck looking like a noose
Yeah, I'll meet her parents , you know I'm not afraid
Her dad asks me questions, I'm still getting laid
Ask me if I'm fancy and treat his daughter nice
Imma treat her nasty and give her all my spice
I respect women and all of you should to
Take her out to dinner and get some Chinese food
Give her my affection if she's in a bad mood
If she's feelin kinky imma get the anal lube
Take her to my place
She sits on my face
Liquids flyin all over the place
Imma use a condom, It's a respectful thing to do
If you do not use one you'll catch a stinky flu

A lot of pain a lot of triumph
Now I've come to the point where I'm happy
You could break me out the strait jacket
This hip-hop is just play action
I switch off and I keep smashing, I'm a legend, fuck the rap-off
They say I can't do my thing, I'ma build my own lane
You come in, you get ran over, but damn, you sober
I'm the god emcee like Hova
But I'm on another level and my grind is over
I’ll put the heat on your back like you're sitting in Rovers
And he always prayed to God I'm just bringing him closer
Feel like I'm doing a bid and my mind in Angola
You be food, then I'm cool, they tried to get over
I stopped picking up my phone, they won't get any closer
They watching my every step because I'm living in motion
Seen it in the hood, I can't, feeling is open
They ask for my money every other day
Like I'm asking for something
But when I had nothing they was laughing
They told me that I'd never make it rapping
It brings tears to see I'm on top, but I told you that I'd make it
14, I was living like my life was the pavement
And I wanted to die, couldn't nobody save me
Now I save my own self and I'm on and I'm famous
And I deal with the haters
Ain't nobody gonna take away what I built
Fuck the death threats, small impostors
But really got the love, but they just choosing that option
When I started to live better, they started to hate
I still got the same brain, that caught all the cases
I've still got the same eyes and seen all the places
But I ain't never been faking
And, it's not a game, it's not the Trail Blazers
Throwing shots but we dying
And the rap game, it's the slave trade
No time for meditation, turning into robots
The Devil is money, it's not even human
The people die for a piece of paper, it's so stupid
Man, live however you do it, I guarantee
You see your life as a child and make you at your all
Just make sure that you smile
But dying every day, ma's look at me now
There was hating, but I never stop, I wanted to drop
But BasedGod gave me strength in the Vans
I gotta really notice my chance, make history, man
Three back, I was feeling like "damn!"
You don't know how I felt when I was washing my hands
Off that filth that was around, I'd never be down
One the streets I'm gone, I never be around
'Cause the hood is a lie
Man, you better wake up before you're dead or surprised
I'm just trying to save myself man
For real, but they trapped in the middle
Don't wanna go to school 'cause the teacher's too simple
I just wanna know where I come from
The truth, tell me, before I desolve
It's connected to the woods, the wilderness is my home
The world say I'm bad because of my color
But they don't get the fact that I say that I love you
People given the option to hustle
Just take it and, I swear to God if you're willing to struggle
And once you pass the bottom you gonna get to the top
It's a lot of hate up in the world, just make sure that you watchLet me tell you how I feel
This the same life I dreamed about when we was kids
And since I got a couple M's
I ain’t gon’ preach to ‘em, but let me speak to ‘em

Bitches runnin’ game and I know they ain’t slick
She gon’ meet a ball player and do the same shit

Ain’t no friends turn frauds
Still waiting on the day a nigga try to pull a card
Loyal to this thing of ours, my youngest down to risk it all
Been a young star, back to back in them cars
In the streets my life was hard so every day I thank God
All praise to Allah, blessed we made it this far
Studied the attraction law, she want me to hit it raw
Now let me tell you how I feel

Boomin’ like Metro til it got raided
Learn the rules to the game ‘fore you play it
They gon’ ask you, better not say shit
Cause what you say gon’ be used in the court of law
He wasn’t built, got in that room and he told it all, damn
Thought that was your friend right?
He should help you do that ten right?
He was with you smilin’, riding in your Benz right?
You was on top, but that shit ain’t air right
Out witnessing the judge’ll lose you
He ain’t even send you money for a pack of noodles
Thought he was real but he fuckin’ fooled you
Different hood, same story, it’s the fuckin’ usual
Now let me tell you how I feel
This the same life I dreamed about when we was kids
And since I got a couple M's
I ain’t gon’ preach to ‘em, but let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em
Let me speak to ‘em

Now I yell “Free Allah, bless the trap niggas!"

Niggas slept on the boss now they ask for favors
Text my phone everyday like they know about me
If you don't fuck with me, don't be around me
Niggas reach on anything that they think is poppin'
Groupies same thing
Haters same thing
Suckas same thing
Niggas play it awkward
Do a lot of movin', but you ain't never talkin'
Dudes like me, I'm preaching what I'm walkin'

She was never sober, I can tell when I look in her eyes
Nigga been through hard times
Shootouts that I wish I died
I know about them stomach aches
That pain that hurt to be alive
I was lost up in them streets
I had to sell them drugs to eat
Them hoes ain't wanna fuck with me

They kno' I had that curly hair
I know I'm lookin' like I'm sweet
I want that boy to disrespect
I never got my ass beat
I had too much pain in me
My life make me angry
If you come from the bottom
Ain't no difference you the same as me
Niggas said they fuck with me
I had to take some time to think
You sold my moma crack and took her link
I ain't have shit to drink
We ate that chili out the can
I had to turn into a man
I was sellin' Reggie nigga
Started out with seven grams
Never had no helpin' hand
One sister and two brother's
I got love for white Shawn
He one crazy motherfucker
I made millions out the trenches
I'm one wavy motherfucker
I know that's a lot of guap for a crack baby motherfucker
Felt like life was just abusing him
We don't post our guns on IG
Cause we be usin' 'em
They like I went to school with him
I ain't have no father figure
Had to go way harder than him
Had to play way smarter than him
Them fucked up nights what sparked him
I'm just glad to be alive
Look my nephew in his eyes
Saw the innocence
I told him that I love him like he mine
That's the type of shit that make you get out here and grind
And for that boy I'm killin' shit
I swear I do that time
Put my life all on the line
I was standin' on that nine
I was three foot to my brother
Fucked it up went two for five
I saw project on that bed
My lil cous lost his leg
I was Chillin' when I got that call
My cous was out that bed
After all them tears I shed

Fuck that, when you hear me talk, you better listen
I’m on the money making mission
Snakes in the grass got a young nigga tripping
Usually I don’t give a fuck
But I been feeling like who the fuck can I trust
When a nigga broke he do whatever for the buck
And I’m getting money so I keep my nine tucked
I got niggas plotting on me, keep that Glock up on me
Hella guap up on me, no you not my homie
I could get you shot up homie, and they ain’t gon find out
Bring them 45s out, every time I ride out
Try to come in my house, leave you inside out
We got choppers with 50 clips, and we be killing shit
Murder the witnesses, anybody could get this shit man
Ain’t nobody innocent, if I start it I finish it
I try and talk to em but, I don’t think they hear me though
Watch for the snakes in the grass nigga, really though
Especially when a nigga on the verge of making plenty dough
Informants tryna get in and see what Bibby on
Then they try to plant seeds all in your head
Got a nigga going crazy, man I think I need some meds
These type of niggas be worse than the feds
Like I got an opportunity for us to get some bread
They smile in your face, lying to your face
You just got to read between the lines of what they say
Insult my intelligence, who they think they effing with?
Fuck around, catch you out and let this MAC 11 spit9th Wonder
Lil B, BasedGod, Based
(Based for your face all day
Based for ya face, my nigga it's all -- yeah)
Brrrangdang, yeah
This is real life from long nights
Niggas like me I bounce back it's alright
Base for your face two times you don't see no actin'
All they do is rhyme words, such typical rappers
I was defined by the struggle, metro phones
Got pictures of my partners that died, people like me
Cried a whirlwind came from drugs and guns
Used to call them cocaine numb
Niggas killas drive-by, the AK-47 took them little kids lives
All these young niggas, it's like a movie
Putting dots on they shirt, talking about Coogi
This is change, please excuse me I rep based world
Nigga, please don't lose me
Base for your face, base for your face, base for your face, base for your face
Base for your face, base for your face, base for your face, base for your face
Real complex rap
Yeah, I just speak, you connect the dots
I'm a rabblerouser, the other rebels they crowd around her
To rebel levels are leveled up in the several thousands
Records house her like Africa read the jungle brothers
This is for townships, backpackers and seasoned lovers of music
Lil B's in love with the music
So leave a brother to use it, lead the public to new shit
See the puppets ain't do it, you keepin' up what they viewin'
You see the numbers they doin', you feedin' us, the three of us
Plus 9th more than Kanye cuff dykes or cuff mics
This my nigga Phonte, Based God, the above types
Above the boundaries of music, the counter-culture groovin'
The kind of combination got you puzzled, Culkin/Kunis
We do what we like so hit the comment section
Do this for life, so what we got in Common, resurrection
We tryin' to bring everythin' back, man
Everything and that includes
Swag
Remember times I was strugglin' off my mindset
Remember that time will fly like a caterpillar
Graduate, I ain't even know that I shoulda
Sometimes don't hate when you know I coulda
Now I'm about to give back to the people, more than ever
Livin' like now or never
Sometimes people get distracted by the outside hate
Life turned into appetizers
And I tell my niggas, be a man of your word
I be fakin' bottomless, fuck it sleepin'
Watch your sleep cause them suckas will trick ya, thinking about niggas
Don't change for nothin'
I go back niggas still swing J's and sufferin'
I'm moving up in the world, gettin' humble as well
Stupid motherfuckers can't tell this real B
Base for your face, base for your face, base for your face, base for your face
Base for your face, base for your face, base for your face, base for your face
Real complex rap
Yeah, I just speak, you connect the dots
I'm back on my shit, pa
Back on my incline, Phontigga raisin' the benchmark
The young lions gave me a kick start
So here it is, pyramid schemin' on y'all niggas like Quixtar
The drug test flow got you pissed off
So many say the game is contaminated, you niggas is animated
Meanin' you not real, fake nigga you Pixar
A short story, Toy Story 3, where the kids are
Now we have lift off, so I'ma just stay firin'
Phontigallo low, stay flyin'
Y'all wannabe niggas stay tryin'
But God is my God, don't be ashamed
Swallow your pride just like a gay lion, roar
Came back for a taste, Lil B, Phontigga back on the case
Feeling like G money in my space
They ain't come back for the cocaine
They came back for the BASECook that shit up, Quay
I can switch my watches with my mood swing
Pull up through the projects in that new thing
She just gave me head she got some good brain
Give her couple dollars 'just my new chain a thousand or two
I can show you what a thousand will do
Call the plug tell him pull up with a thousand or two
I got family to feed, I got niggas say they need me
Got a lot of shit on my plate but I ain't tripping cause I'm greedy
They got my lil nigga worried cause his daughter she obese
She a premature baby and the doctor say she need 'em
He got fees but he don't got money but he got ski masks
And he got a black 45 screaming "need more cash"
A nigga ask me do I got some murder for hire
Lovin' on a bitch I prolly won't know her tomorrow
My lil partner from the westside caught a murder case
Say his lawyer want a hundred but he got 50k
Told me that he had a feeling he was halfway
Told him I got the other fifty I don't want no games, no games
I don't play no games I'm going straight up
I just want my muthafuckin paper
On the private jet me DT Tiger gangsta
Tryna go into the lands and get this paper
Running through the land like I'm 6-0
You had to tap in I was get it when it wrapped in
 racks in
I was running through LA at All Star getting a pack in
You was getting extorted heard the homies made you tap in
And heard the homie he got-"Hello?"
Man, what's up?
Uhhh, I can't believe this, man
So I just got some news from the doctor, man
I got AIDS, goddamn, I can't believe this shit
The last time I fucked was my girl, I can't believe that
I let me think "Goddamn, it was another girl"
Got a lot of things in my life, but now I'm in the swirl
No protection, I should've used a condom
Instead of trusting these women. I never got tested
I felt fine, I never got sick, plus I look good
My mom said "keep your dick in your pants, and you be good"
I was worried about getting her pregnant
Not knowing she had full-blown AIDS, and she sexin'
Everybody, cause real talk, she ain't even tell me
Mad at her last man, she held the pain in her belly
Damn
Yo, I heard that motherfuckers said I'm HIV positive
What is going on?
 "Oh my God, are you serious?"
What the fuck, man? I wouldn't be lying about it
Now there's something you gotta tell me
What you gotta tell me?
Now I'm fucked cause I had unprotected sex
Take it from me: go get checked, that be your best bet
On top of that, I got herpes when she gave me AIDS
My life ending early if I don't got no cash to pay
Magic Johnson, only one still alive
Sitting down all alone, it makes me want to cry
I can go back in time, I would've used a condom
Now I'm dying, saying "goodbye" to my momma
Damn
Yo, what the fuck, man?
My life's about to be over, man
My life's over. I can't fucking believe it
Man, that's all you gotta say, man
Both our lives done now
I probably fucking won't be able to trust nobody ever again
 "Oh God... "
I'mma talk to you later, that's all I can say
 "Okay, please call me back"
I wanna tell everybody, make sure y'all get tested, man
This is not a game
A lot of people have STDs right now and don't even know it
You look perfectly fine and you feel fine
It takes a few months a few months for something to form in your body
But you can have it and be perfectly fine
Make sure you're not transferring these STDs to other people
I know it hurts, sometimes you don't even want to know
But to protect the world and be fair to everybody else, make sure you get tested
And don't trust nobody because a lot of people are lying
A lot of people don't even really know
And don't think cause a person looks good that they "free"
Cause there's a lot of people that got HIV

If they be conscious take em to coma, yah
A-R-T-I-S-T-S, fuck out my way
빨리 내려 차에 fuck out my RAY
난 원해 cake and add a little fame, 돈에 내 목을 매
We uneducated kids, 이젠 한 곳만 응시, yeah
Oh, what a beautiful shit
앨범을 냈어
나 역시 생각하게 됐어 은퇴를
아니면 형들처럼 받아야겠어 레슨생을
항상 내 뜻대로 살아왔지만 나도 이제는
그만둬야겠어, ’녹색이념'의 김태균
Yeah, 기억나 3년 전에, '녹색이념'을 냈을 적에
다 소리가 구리대
귀 찢어지는 음악엔 "와, sound 죽이네"
도대체 두 귀에 뭘 박아두길래 구린데
Duplex G, 강욱의 beat가?
너네 두 귀를 믿은 건 우리들 실수야
우리를 평가한 니네들 이어폰 오천 원짜리, yeah
1억짜리 음반 줬지만 구별 못하지, yeah
심판을 맡아 주어야 했던 이들은 어디?
얘네들 관심은 음악보다 Insta 언팔, man fuck this
명반 내려다 적자, 어차피 아무도 몰라주는
자기만족 뿐인 거라면 지금 빨리 접자
세상에서 제일 한국 힙합이 싫은 평론가들
또 음악을 어떻게 난도질할지 기다려볼까?
가사를 왜 써? freestyle 해서
녹음과 mix 전부 집에서 끝내야겠어
음악에 왜 써, 귀중한 시간과 돈을?
가사를 왜 써? freestyle 해서
녹음과 master 전부 집에서 끝내야겠어
음악에 왜 써, 귀중한 시간과 돈을?
이제는 이해가 돼, 날 떠나갔던 씨발년, yeah
이제는 이해가 돼, 한국 힙합이 구리단 놈, yeah
이제는 이해가 돼, 다들 노선을 뒤바꾼 이유
이제는 이해가 돼, 난 Deepflow도, yeah
이제야 만날 준비가 된 듯해 난 '누명'의 김진태와
이젠 십대가 아닌 곧 서른이 되는 어른의 대화
만약에 만나게 된담 듣고 싶어 대답
'야, 나도 이 바닥에서 그저 거름이 될까?'
진짜가 진짜를 알아본다면 날 소문내, 마치 Okasian
실력 있다고 돈을 번다면 날 수렁에서 빨리 꺼내줘
모두가 평등하다고 믿어왔지만
씨발놈아 날 떠받들어
거기가 어디건, Show Me The Money건
어서 날 올려 심사위원에, cuz I’m the one
꼬마들 어서 이 자극에 반응해
어쩌면 날 더는 볼 수가 없어 오늘의 다음엔
벌써 두세 장의 음반을 명반의 반열에
나라면 당장 돈을 다 쓸어 담는 게 당연해
Yeah, ’TakeOne For The Team'
’녹색이념', '사랑과 평화', ’Good Time For The Team'
내 '상업예술' 또한 명작에 예정 돼 있지
나 역시 닿을 수 없는 곳으로 어느새 와있지
야, 이걸 듣고 잠든다면 정말 너 문제 있어
난 이미 여기 살아있는 전설이 돼있어
벌써 잊었다면 오늘 다시 각인해둬
난 rapper들의 rapper, TakeOne
내가 죽길 바랬던 좆집 새끼들에게 전해
I'm back on my bullshit
너네가 심부름 센터 알아볼 때까지
난 절대 안죽을테니까
니네 하는 헛짓 다 무의미
Y'all just hating for the hatred
그게 의미해 니들의 미성숙
넌 안되있어 우릴 맞을 준비, uh
구라치는 틀딱들 앞니 깨진 거 모아서
베개 밑에 뒀네, 가져와 니 충치, ha
너무 많아 rappers
그래서 my rap verse 쓸 때 난 Thanos
여기서 반이상은 사라져도
지장 없어서 무덤 한개 더 열지
Motherfuckers 어서 들어가
시간 없네, 다음거 하러 가야되니 빨리 묻어놔
Um, 유명세와 명예는 같을 수 없네
연예인과 여기에 남을
몇개 이름, 단어들은 전혀 다르지, 어떻게
우리가 같은 시대 음악을 향유하고 자라왔는지
의심이 갈 때 좆밥들끼린 공감대 형성해
하지만 봐, I fuck with the 허 professor
그러니까 존심 삼키고 말 골라서 뱉어
'수준 이하', 이 네글자가 시대성을 대변
그러니까 죽어라 하는 새끼들만 좆 됐어
망하는 지름길이 real한 거니 난 진작에 두번 망했지
명반 혹은 classic은 시대에 뒤쳐진 미친 짓이 됐으니
근데 난 미친 새끼마냥 rapper들 사냥하는게 낙이야
Bitch, yeah, I'm a prolly type of psycho
누가 남아있어?
OG인 척 지인 장사하는 fake ass
Insta app 킬 때만 힙합인 새끼들 다 줘패는
내 가사가 너희에게는 괴롭겠지
흠집 내려해봐, 그래봤자 난 명경지수의 마음
내 흔들리지 않는 편안함
그래서 여자들 침대로 와
근데 이젠 미친년들 발로 차
구분이 가, 움직임이 다 눈에 보여, that bitch move
내 싯구는 내 식구들을 위해서만 쓰일 뿐
집중해서 rhythm 탈 땐 방해물 치우는 기분
Yeah, that's wassup, 난 best of the best
덜떨어진 부류와 상종 못하는 내 stance
꺾어 보려면 니 인생 땡겨 써
Yeah, that's wassup, 난 best of the best
덜떨어진 부류와 상종 못하는 내 stance
꺾어 보려면 니 인생 땡겨 써
Yeah, that's wassup, 난 best of the best
덜떨어진 부류와 상종 못하는 내 stance
꺾어 보려면 니 인생 땡겨 써
Yeah, that's wassup, 난 best of the best
덜떨어진 부류와 상종 못하는 내 stance
꺾어 보려면 니 인생 땡겨 써
Ayy, 내게 돈을 부쳐 줘, 싫음 말어
그래, 니 말대로 다 실력탓?
근데 저 새끼들 앨범 시끄럽다
망해도 난 만들어 퀄리티 음악
그럴려고 돈 번거지, 저 새끼들 봐
월 억 찍었는데 걍 돈 번 거지, ha
영향력 없지, 걍 인기만 많아
니 인생은 타버린 cigar와 같아
반면 난 패 놓은 장작이 많아
이미 세상 내놓은 창작이 많아
나 돈 없는 거 아냐
근데 세상 기준이 넘 높아 없는 놈 맡아
질문이 많지만 답은 없네
예술인으로서 나는 걷네
찾고 있어 내가 견지해야할 태도
근데 쨌든 올랐네 경지에
내 rap은 내게 숨 쉬기, 너무 쉽지, hol' up
웃기네, rap을 시작했을 때 가장 갖고싶던 건 skill이니
근데 갖고나니 쓸 데가 없네, 5천만이 귀머거리니
아는 놈들끼리도 꺼리니
한 쪽 비난하려는 거 아냐
나도 그 현상의 원인 중 지분있지
근데 무지 허무할 수도 있지만 conclusion
벗어날래 이곳에서, 전부 bullshit이니
난 걍 hustler, 돈 벌어 내 능력껏
내 능력이 뭐냐고 묻는다면 이미 듣고있어 넌
근까 돈을 부쳐 줘, 근데 돈이 안 돼
박리다매, 근까 나는 과외를 할게
맘에 안 든다면 shot을 쏴
근데 그게 너의 인생 마지막 rap이
될 수도 있다는 가능성 다시 한 번 알길
나도 하기 싫어 시간 낭비
그래, 나 rap fuckin' 장인
15분이면 니네 관을 짜지
지금 나보다 돈 많이 버는
Rapper들의 5년짜리 verse를 쓰지
모르면 니 귀가 문제지, 설명, listen
불량 식품만 백날 쳐먹는 놈들
미슐랭 가이드를 받아도 맛 없겠지 요리
그냥 그 이름값땜에 평점 남기겠지 100점
그러니 내 rap 구리다하면 get your taste up
그게 내가 말할 수 있는 전부, 니 입맛 개 구려
자유롭게 살고싶은데 그러지 못하는 자신이 개 구려
자유롭게 살고 있는 J-This 욕하고 겨우 잠에 들어
That's your life bitch, I already know it
근데 널 사랑해 했었지 고민, 근데 이제 관뒀지
나만 챙겨, 내 주변 챙기려 필요해 돈
그러니 전화 때려 to Indigo Music
JUSTHIS 대한민국 rap number one이지
근데 주면 다 해, 니가 줄 건 ₩on이지
앨범을 냈었으나 이제는 안 낼거야
Fuck, 걍 돈이나 땡겨
대한민국 내 위대함을
소비할 수 있는 지갑이 없네 다 개털, umm
또 개소리한다 생각하겠지
왜냐면 너가 개인 걸
모든 이 자신의 경험치가 견지
그러니 너에겐 최선이 나에겐 최소, umm
내 동공에 맺히는 상 예술로 communication
내 동료는 다 승화 됐어, umm
이제 난 다음 step으로
배운 게 못 배운 놈들한테서 배운 거래서 못 됐어
패고 패고 또 패도 피떡 되도
그 위에다가 오줌을 갈기네요
이 씹새끼가 살리네요 이 scene
새꺄, back to the 2005 attitude
승이 오빠 왔나봐 Tom Ford oud wood 향, umm
인 걸 아는 여자들과 놀아났고 난 좆까, umm
법칙, 규칙 좆까, 너나 해 삼류 연예인 오빠, umm
최소임금도 보장 안되는 점에서는 노가다도 못한, umm
밥그릇에 욕같이 비벼 넣고 삼시세끼 소화하는 삶, fuck that
니가 뭘 알겠어, 좀 닥쳐
넌 가서 해 K hip-hop이나
형들 술자리 끊고 산 넌
한국 hip-hop 담론에 낄 순번부터 뽑길
환기 안 돼, 인기만 많네, 영향력 0, zero
이 차이를 이해 못해 넌
Rapper들의 rapper 난 됐고, 걍 됐어 괴물
나만 지켰던 게 rule, 이제 난 rule 없어
오로지 내 rule은 지배에만 해당 돼
'지지배'하면 여혐 돼?
과학적으로 우리는 다른데?
넌 에스트로겐, 난 테스토스테론
Rapper들이 말 많아야 하는 시대
다 입 닫고 있는 거에 대해 어떻게 생각하녜
엄홍식 형님께서, 사석에서, 난 팔렸네 쪽
그래서 보여주러 나왔네
Real recognize real, 나는 cape on
Hero든 Villain이든 앞에 'Super' 붙었을 때 능력
한 쪽 진영 결과, 평등만을 주장해
무식한 소리들만 내 귓전에 남아, 지 무덤 팠네
인류가 자연을 상대로 추구해야하는 자세는
기회의 평등이 맞네
설리가 말하네 hater들한테
'다 되돌아갈텐데 그땐 더 많이 아플 거'라고, word up
'좆만한 국힙 니네끼리 해쳐먹어'라고 하고 난 또 해쳐먹어
헤헤, 어쩌라고
Rap 잘하고 음악 잘하면 장땡
니 패 삼팔광땡이면 드루와
But remember my man Don Malik
그리고 알지 DOPPELGÄNGEM ILLINIT형 got my back
근데 추가 됐지 이 track 위로 한 패가 늘어났네
근데 난 패 없거든, 이름에도 전적에도, you knamsayin'
'아, 시발, 걍 다 귀찮아, 걍 판 엎어'가 내 태도
길렀지 실력, 오로지 뱉고픈 말 잘 뱉기 위해서
근데 뱉고픈 말 없어졌으니 걍 돈 땡겨
급 맞아야 경기도 열리지, Mayweather
상대 선정하고 싶으면 먼저 이뤄내 뭘

Used to walk around with eight grams in my briefs
Now I'm on planes, getting change overseas
All I had to do is use my brain and believe
Think it's time to give the rap game what it need
Do this for the city, I'm the one they let speak
I'm the one that's giving all the game for the free
Do this for the real niggas just like me
Man if I get shot, is it Heaven for a G?
Heavy in the streets, lot of threats sent at me
So I ride around, MAC-11 on the seat
Won't they let a nigga be
Made it out the streets, I'm a god, I'm a chief
Yeah, real talk I'm something else
Doing all this shit with no help, real nigga what's up?

Be in the street, put my life on the line

Luke told me, "Go hard," he ain't have to say it twice
Get a nigga murked, let me think, what's your price?
Give my boys the word, they'll do the shit tonight

‘Cause I swore I'd be caught by the cops
Either that or probably get shot
Gotta watch your back ‘cause there's niggas like dissin'
Heard you got the juice, now them boys out there pitchin'
Been around the world, now I see the bigger picture
Feeling like Hova, Biggie or Mystik
Soon as you make it, niggas gon' hate it
When they see success niggas don't know how to take it
You just turned from nothing into something in they faces
Now them niggas plotting on your money, tryna take it
Nigga, it's real
I won't lie, I can't lie
Been in the street, put my life on the line
I won't lie, I can't lie
I won't lie, I can't lie

Thank you for
Blessin' me with the present, in fact

Even to how you dress makes the silents guess
I ain't never wore a Guess, bitch I know what I want
Five-somethin' short dude with the presence of Dr. King
Ask about the boss from the summer to spring
They'll tell you that my name mean more than the phrase
I'm more than a game
And I kept on the fame
And I really been true, shit, like a counsellor
That's how I used to be, with the devilish stares
Quickly; that turned to the moment I'm in
Because I can't sit in jail, that was never my friend
Ask if I go back? I say "never again"

Switched my game up from a legend to a prophet
Stepped my guns up from a 40 to a rocket

The type of new money you ain't puttin' in your wallet
I done seen the kind of cash you can't put it in your pocket
And I ain't with the secrets man, I let you know your option, man

I'm just a California boyNiggas gotta make it, I'm serious, niggas gonna make it, seriously. You hear me, I come from that straight under shit. They really fucking with me, ya feel me?
I only live one time, I'm trying to keep my head right
Niggas doing fed time, that's similar to me
I be going hard, so I'm facing like 55
Niggas don't want that, I be selling dope sacks
Niggas want me dead cos I'm still in the states
I be at Fort Knox; nigga, I am a cop
Ride with intel on ya, my life full of pain
Niggas don't understand, niggas don't even care
Man, I'm just on my dick, niggas didn't give me cash
How I'm gonna move?  Don't know how I'm gonna move 
Come with that chopper, then I'm gonna act a fool
My niggas wanted trophies, but I wanted cases
Niggas heard my rap, then they said I'm going places
Kept me off the street, all them boys living dead
Niggas eating fast food, niggas serving fast dope
Niggas catching hot bullets, you ain't going to war
Niggas lost the streets, niggas want to keep the peace
Niggas act out of pocket, niggas get dealt with
Straight top shelf shit, make a nigga melt quick
Ain't no rumors, them boys on repeat
All the shit that I did, some days I couldn't
I couldn't go to sleep
Traumatized, chasing me down
They had that shit, but I still live
Don't respect me, niggas ain't checked me
I had real beef and I didn't let it stress me
Real 05, I'm really 05
Fuckers hate, I was based in 05
2013, niggas mad I'm still grinding
I'm still alive and they hate that
Niggas gonna hate that, I paint the Maybach
You feel me, and I'm not from the hood, what?
That's okay, but them choppers gonna spray
How you a vet if you ain't in the Oak?
Say you a dope dealer but you got a Purple Heart
Robbed them meth labs and I burnt them bitches
Never crossed real niggas, I've burnt no bridges
05 Fuck Em mixtapeAh, so I think by now you may be confused as to what we're doing
We're making an entire piece of content from scratch
Which is where the best things in life come, the best things in life come from nothing
And become something different, so, you know
This is an allegory to life, and life is an allegory to this shit, I guess
Chano, Chano, Chano, Chano, Chano, what's next?
Chano, Chano, Chano, Chano, Chano, what's next?
Brandon, Brandon, Brandon, Brandon, Brandon what's next?
Brandon, Brandon, Brandon, Brandon, Brandon what's next?
I tell them light, it's gonna shine on you
Tell 'em more, watch that shit shine on you
Woke up this morning, didn't know what's next
Then I read a text, asking me what's next
Sent back a text, said "mind your own"
When you find your home, go to sleep and dream your own
Dream, don't follow what it seems to me
Everything you see ain't what it seems to be
And I gotta hella dreams, hella dreams to speak
So I guess that that shit's meta, or just beta
And we spell it B-E-T-A, that means it's on trial
That means for a while, it won't be finished
But when that shit's finished, ah, just look at that finish
Ah, I'm still off that tone, but I still take care of business
Had to freak it up, had to mix it up, had to geek it up
Every week you know, you look online, hella leaks is up
Ain't no album coming out, ain't no shit coming, no, no soon
When I'm in the room and I'm lit and gone and I make the tunes
Go ahead B
I, I keep going and I'ma blast them
I'ma show these bitches that it's not all fashion
I don't wear these clothes for the fucking fashion
I wear clothes cause I'm fast and I'm hungry
I don't give a fuck about these niggas think I'm funny
I hold K's, A's and fucking dummies
I'm like in the fucking cut, I'm a fucking mummy
I got so much money I need a fucking mummy
I need help and shit because my health and shit is irrelevant
While I'm chasing this paper, I'm running so fast
I'm like chasing a laser, these niggas can't see me
I be chasing a waiter, these motherfuckers serve me
All looking for so many tips, these niggas just working me
You gotta understand this pain when you hear this beat
I'm like AK47, can't you hear the streets?
What's up keyboard kid? I got niggas underground that's doing four bids

Lil B, mental, you know, niggas is trapped in prison
It's time to live our life, mental, physical, all that
Mental slavery, niggas be hanging off of trees in the woods
Like the hood, it's more than Martin Luther King
Fighting for a dream
Watch me go against everything you believe
They desrespect you tryna spark a dream
Everybody knows it's easy to fail but it's harder to think, think twice
I'm nicer than grandma with a cup of iced tea
You see me, I got ice like Ice
Serving them ice the same color small mice
Leaving my office, huh, he gon' pay a small price
My advice: get out of the game
They giving you chains, new car and they taking your chains
Never with chains, the chains fastened, I'm switching the lanes
I got away, got caught in the game
You always complain about what you ain't got
Third world countries ain't even got sidewalks to walk on
Two hundred people on the bus
And we busting moves harder than I ever thought
You never lost before you ever won
I never won, I'm still hungry, forever young
My soul hurt but I still move on, deep feelings aside
Feel like a clone, I'm trapped in the USA
Where work is your home, no work, ain't gon' talk on the phone
I've been born in the war, I grew up
I seen more ever since the twenty-eighth floor
Looked down, I never seen more poverty before
From the top you see even more, I fight for the even draw
Before you even draw I'm already gone
With the heat drawn, my gun like Miami Heat, you're gone
Focused like Steve Nash, I pick my brain apart
Thinking about breathing last
Uhh, s-see that casket
It's so close, it's like I'm a basket, go away
Step back faster, like your girlfriend just dumped him faster
Graveyard waiting, trying to stay away from the hating
S-s, whatever, fuck the locations
Trespassing, never close those pages
Never wanna cheat man, the thief's outrageous
Never been a bad farmer, if you put your
Heart in it, who gonna come up to you
I dare niggas to say that I'm weak, you uncomfortable
Waiting for everything, man, the people
Like me and you, we gotta get one thing together
And that thing I don't know
But peace is the first step, pepping your step
I ain't a drug dealer, I'm just a life liver
Like your liver fold like an open river
See between your eyes, I can see your pain
This is music for the ones that got away
If you ran away, hope that you stay, stay Based, you feel me?
Sss, for real, man
They try to take the real people
If you got a good heart treat yourself like the President
Cause the bag'll suck you right in
Want you to be in the grave right beside them
Because they got a cold, they want you to have a cold, I stick by the code
I let the story unfold, I say a lot of things, it's been told
I'm not scared, you asshole
At least I lived the dream, my daddy make the cash flow
Even if the cast goes, starts losing family
I buy back their lifespan with any type of money
You got one life: better live it
Can't be a leader if you're scared to make decisions
Living 2Pac and Biggie's visions, Lil B, I'm trapped in prisonYou already know what the word is coming up next, so we don't even need to say that. 
I'mma shouts out to Chicago, shouts out to New Mexico, you feel me?

Now this, uh, P.Y.T. Pretty Young Thug mixtape, we doing whatever we do, okay? I'mma do whatever I want. Okay? And you gon' have to remember that. Motherfuckers gon' come through, we gon' thug or whatever. But, the topic of the situation is
Lil BVoglio fare, voglio fare, ta-ta
Voglio fare, voglio fare, voglio fare
Mr. Monkey
Voglio fare un euro al secondo anche se devo morire in una villa al mare
Però ricco e da solo, sotto una lapide d'oro
Con una corona in testa, stavo sognando e mi sveglio
Diavoli vogliono avermi, hanno già perso in partenza
Già me la vedo la faccia, dicono: "Troppo scurrile"
Rido fumandone un'altra mentre ti stendi due righe
La mia musica come la -ina, ci rimani sotto
Mentre balla musica latina lancio in aria condom
Non puoi starmi appresso, sono il Lil della nazione
Posso insegnarti a farle, non ascoltavo a lezione
Una seconda vita negli USA, 8 di mattina la pattuglia
7-Eleven, prendo la busta, viste di cose, mai detto nulla
A Biancaneve stai attento, è come se ti fermano e ce l'hai acceso
In una villa contento mi suona il cellulare, stavo dormendo
Fumo appena mi sveglio, vedevo le palme giù dal terrazzo
Pensavo che una sola sarebbe bastata e di ricordare tutto a fine serata
A Biancaneve stai attento, è come se ti fermano e ce l'hai acceso, ehi
In una villa contento mi suona il cellulare, stavo dormendo, ehi
Fumo appena mi sveglio, vedevo le palme giù dal terrazzo
Pensavo che una sola sarebbe bastata e di ricordare tutto a fine serata
No, ma non mi ricordo più un cazzo, ho perso i pezzi del puzzle
Quando mi sveglio borbotto, quando c'è il sole rincaso
Ma non mi ricordo più un cazzo, ho perso i pezzi del puzzle
Quando mi sveglio borbotto, quando c'è il sole rincaso
Ehi, Piccolo Pietro, queste ragazze gradiscono Pietro
Uh, ehi, mignolo teso, prendilo in bocca col mignolo teso
Uh, ehi, idolo greco, voglio una statua "Sei un idolo Pietro"
Uh, ehi, vicolo cieco, discolo in disco, rapiscono Pietro, uh
Sto capito, sennò sarei già impa-pa-pazzito
Ti vedo ap-pa-pa-passito, il tuo treno è già passato
Mamacita prende il braccio, dice il dito
Ma se i racconti sono i nazisti, sarò Picasso sulla Guernica, ehi
A Biancaneve stai attento, è come se ti fermano e ce l'hai acceso, ehi
In una villa contento mi suona il cellulare, stavo dormendo, ehi
Fumo appena mi sveglio, vedevo le palme giù dal terrazzo
Pensavo che una sola sarebbe bastata e di ricordare tutto a fine serataThis bitch call me one more time talkin' crazy on my mothafuckin' phone
Bitch you better quit callin' my fuckin' phone
I'ma break her mothafuckin' neck
I swear I'ma strangle that bitch
Watch what the fuck that you say to me
I hang with killas, don't play with me
My mama, she told me she hated me
Now she be calling' me, tryna get cake from me
You know that I live with the chopper
It sleep in the closet, I told it, "Come lay with me"
I turned the trap to an agency
Didn't want to, but they're makin' me
I'm supposed to be keepin' the peace
But I swear these young niggas unleashin' the beast
Man it ain't no love in the streets
I fell in love with my heat
Caught me an oppa in traffic
My bro started clappin', left blood on the seats
I left your cousin deceased
Cause he would have done it to me
Bibby, I'm back on the grind
I keep them stacks on my mind
My squad like a pack of them lions
We trap with a 9, packin' the iron
I think the devil took over me
I swear that I think it's a ghost in me
I took my gun to the store with me
It don't want leave, I'm like go with me, go with me
I whip with the left, I'm Ginobili
K in the trunk like some groceries
He wanna fight cause he see that his hoe with me
I got my pipe, I aim right at his ovaries
Yeah I know I said ovaries
Cause he a bitch, he a hoe to me
All of my killers'll go for me
I just might open a trap right on Oglesby
Watch what the fuck that you say to me
Out here with killers, don't play with me
Watch what the fuck that you say to me
All of my niggas is killers, don't play with me

Out here with Benjamin Franklins
Hundreds and 50s, I say the shit

Cops tried to call for a raid
Your boyfriend, he work like a slave
It look like he need a raise
You know that your wifey been hittin' me

The many windswept yellow stickies of my mind
Or the molten emotional front line
I couldn't care less, I'm transfixed in this absolute bliss
Illusions of Grandeur
This is my pain and this is my life
I have so many questions
I'm based for life
I was a robber, turned positive
The plans started out
One guy, one gun
Another person, so add one
Two people, one gun
One car they stole it from
An unknown, ride slow
One bottle of alcohol
Two people with bad thoughts
One time to lose it all
You never learn, you never fail
Never walk, you never crawl
Back to the subject
One lesson, two knuckle-heads
One listen to the other
They both robbing for the supper
Lord forgive them
One is... The product of the environment
Good upbringing with no father
I'm sorry
He took the harder route, regardless
He was a little smaller
To get respect he had to dog 'em
For the girls
He wanted to be the hero or anti-hero
One dude was a nerd
Got picked on and went berserk
They both teamed-up
Found a common and that was robbing
Drinking liquor
At the age to feel no pain
We robbing brainless
Deep for the cheddar
A pain I can't explain
To see that window shatter
My blood's like a stain
Tainted evidence, the pain
Hard with the police
Gather the evidence
You ain't a robber, you ain't gon' feel this shit
Maybe I ain't mainstream
I cry cause I want the world
I'm scared that these niggas would celebrate my death
I guess... The world is deep, novo
Fuck you bitch
I'm thugged out, I love this shit
So educated I can go out and discuss this shit
Bringing back matters to the public
I like, I love it
This is the life of a robber
Illusions of Grandeur
The most prolific mixtape to ever come out in hip-hop
Let this change your life how it changed mine

Feelin' so guttah open up the matches
I'll lay ya boy, motivate ya team
Got the game playin', all you need is me

And I don't gotta gas cause I'm about that life

Man slow yo roll down bell, it breaks too fast
Come up over here, I'mma break his ass

05 Fuck Em Mixtape
I fuck with Lil B cause he the rawest rapper alive, that's why I rock with him
Lil B, Rawest rapper alive
I fuck with you Lil BMan. I love y’all, man. I hope this table don’t fall and everything stays smooth. First off, NYU I want to say I love you. And thank each and every one of you, every beautiful person in the building, every legend, every historical human being. You know, every future legend in the building, man. I’m in the building with the future. Y’all going to be helping me when things get hard for me. That’s what I hope. I hope everybody leaves this conversation together feeling like family. This is not everybody listening to me, this is everybody is a part of it. If you feel compelled to say something in your heart, please do, because at the end of the day we all have something to teach, and we all have something to say
I want to come to this with a story that I feel symbolizes everybody in the building. This happened to me two days ago. I’m going to the gas station and this older guy—he looks like he’s about 70. Me generalizing and stereotyping, I asked him, “Yo, excuse me sir, how you doing? What has changed for you in the last years? From like when you was younger until now?” And he was like, “You really wanna know?” And I was like, “Yes, sir, I really want to know.” And he was like, “You know what has changed?” And he was like, “Your attitude.” And that was deep, bro! That was deep! I feel that represents us all of us today
I thank y’all for not judging me and being able to respect us being humans. That’s what we should all be able to do. I specialize in love. A lot of people wonder, the small majority who don’t understand wonder why Lil B would be here. But you know, it’s good. I love to spread love, you know. That’s what I’m here to do
This is the big thing I want to speak on to set the tone: Nobody in this building asked to be born. You didn’t ask to be you, bro. I didn’t ask to be me. I didn’t ask to have this skin. I didn’t ask to be who I was, bro. Nobody in here asked that. The beautiful people? Your beautiful parents made you, bro. You didn’t ask for that. You didn’t ask to live where you live or anything. So when you see people, forgive them and accept, you feel me? You gotta open your mind and say, man, nobody asked to be born. Life is hard, kinda
Ay, bruh, I love you positively. I love all y’all. With relationships and women and being together and everybody, man, it’s just like… It’s just real. I’m just happy you guys are getting the real me. No pen, no pad. I didn’t script a speech. I come here and all I can do is be myself and spread love. But with relationships and stuff man, I’m just taking it slow. Taking it easy. A lot of things are happening real fast and I’m just taking my time and respecting women, respecting others. I mean, but that’s obvious, though. To respect women is obvious, yo
And a big thing I’ve been thinking about is the tone with a lot of people I meet and the media, I see it’s a lot of: If you get hit, you hit back. Why is that? Real recognize real, bro. You get blessed out of situations. I did that situation because I wanted the world to see that you can have a million stones thrown at you and you can still be positive. You know, that was kind of embarrassing. I had a lot of hood credibility . I had a lot of imaginary hood respect. But you know, at the end of the day, it’s no respect in being violent or a coward for no reason. It’s no honor in picking on people. It’s no honor in senseless violence. It’s no honor in war
But at the end of the day, I look at animals and insects. You know I’m the first rapper to adopt a tabby cat. You know I adopted straight from the ASPCA, you feel me? Just breaking the boundaries, man, showing everybody it’s okay to be yourself. Embrace yourself. Embrace your health. Ayyy! Just continue to love yourself and accept
I can’t lie, when I was younger I loved the media. I believed the media. I can say I was a product of my environment. You know, you grow up. I remember when I was younger, I didn’t know how to walk. I was so young, I was wondering how I was walking. Am I walking weird? Something’s in my butt? You know what I mean? But really so conscious, though. So hard on myself. And I say through time and love it’s just easing up on yourself, easing up on life
It’s a lot of words people have given so much power. When I mean things to be specific, it’s that tone of you hit me I hit you. That’s not right. The new generation as I see it, how I hold my integrity, why I conduct myself in the way I do—people see me and they say, “He didn’t retaliate or taunt that man, and he could have.” There are people that love me. People were upset. But just because somebody wants to fight you for no reason, or because somebody says something to you, you can forgive that person. I’d be that guy’s friend. You’ve gotta move on and be positive. We’re way past dwelling. I spread that love. Keep it and don’t be hard on yourself with anything, how you look to your weight to wanting to complete what your parents want you to be. Don’t stress so hard. Pat yourself on the back. You’re at NYU. Congratulations. What you guys are doing is very brave. Everybody that is going through school, you’ve made a huge sacrifice. All the staff, all the beautiful students, everybody that’s here to teach. Shouts out to everybody that’s here for learning and love and trying to find their way. I mean, shit. I mean, shoot. We’re all trying to find our way. I want to thank you for embracing and accepting me, like really. I love you
I want to show: have friends of all creeds, all colors, all races. Stop saying, black, white, this, that—we’re all human. Now I don’t know everything. This is my philosophy. But I feel like things are just generalizations. Drop all that. Stop giving negative words so much power. Instead of saying, “Hey, look at him, he’s black,” just say, “Hey, where are you from? What is your nationality?” Just take two seconds instead of generalizing, because, I promise you, I looked up what black means online, and black means something like coal, you feel me?
We all got problems too, bro, real talk. We all can have something that we can relate to. Make sure you can relate and have a common. And if you do feel too different, make sure you respect the people. Give people a chance to come in your heart. I know why a lot of people don’t trust people. You know why? There’s a lot of mean, bad people out here. A lot of people don’t have a value on their own life. They don’t have a value on how blessed we are to be alive. Our generation right here, we’re on a class of earth together. This is our class. All of us are going to be like, “Hey, remember 20 years ago when we did that?” Don’t be hard on each other. Let your friends have fun. Work hard and do what you do because we’ve only got one life to live. That is scary, you know. It’s scary and it’s really real, it’s really true. It just makes me appreciate people. Appreciate every single person. Look at them like a golden, million-dollar baby. Ay, bruh, I’ma tell you the real secrets of life, bruh. Ay, bruh, feel me, bruh, I got the real secrets. For real, bro. For real. Real talk: the secrets of life? Look at everybody like they’re a baby. Remember like, man, we’re young. Don’t be so hard on people. We’re just little baby insects or mammals or whatever. You feel me?
I tell you, bruh, I was looking at insects. I do my observations when I go out. If I become a neurosurgeon or I’m about to come into some bugs, I’m rocking. With the bugs, man, you just be looking at them. Because I was having these big ant problems in my house. It was crazy. And these are people in their own way, too. As I was studying these ant colonies infesting my house daily, I’m not kidding you, I left food out and 20 minutes later r-r-r-r-r and I’m like, man, they already know! They get it down pat! And real talk, like, seeing these ants and studying them and respecting them, it’s like, man, they’re in their own community too. They’re trying to
Survive. They love. They fight. They telling themselves something. We can’t understand, but one day we will. I’m trying hard to figure it out. I’m there with them. We’re very smart animals, you know, or whatever we are. Organisms? What are we? What do y’all think we are? Is there like a fact? Does anybody have any proof what we are? Live that life, experience it, travel, and come up with your theories man. Read the books, too, but experience your own. It’s crazy
Some of the things I think about on the daily: I just want my people to be safe.  Safety, man. And real talk, everybody make sure you wear seat belts, for real
Man, I’m pro-caring. That’s a big thing we should bring back. Let’s bring back caring about each other, honestly, genuinely. Anybody can have their preconceived notion about me. They can be like, “I think he looks like this and I have my vision in my head.” But after the day, break that down. Look at me and I’m not what you think. Some people not even be thinking nothing about me. They might have love. They might look at me like a baby, like a little alien. Cuddle. Hold me. But, man, bruh, all this is is a positive healing. With this historical time together I want everybody in this building to know everybody is your friend here. People that love Lil B’s music and respect Lil B from the core, we’re about positivity and not judging, letting people be theyselves. Be yourself one hundred and one thousand percent. Everybody man, from the sides to the back to the middle to the sides, you might not even know people, but if you rock with Lil B music and respect me from the core, you should know that based means you have someone you can trust, because we all have a common courtesy. It’s about having empathy now. What I mean is really caring and paying attention to somebody else’s feeling. You gotta have empathy and know we all on this common vibe. It’s all peace. It’s saying, hey, you know what, you can hit me and I’m not hitting you back. And that takes a very big person to do that. If someone attacks you or your family, at the end of the day you do what you gotta do. But I’m saying, if you really want to be a bigger person?
I go to sleep and I’m so happy. You know why? I know I’m living what I’m talking about. I go to sleep and I’m like, nyah. On my bean bag like nyah. I’m making history and I’m living it and I’m honest. It feels so good to be honest. Honest as we can be. Nyah. Honesty, integrity, loyalty, passion, friendship. For real, man, that’s real
It’s funny, you feel me, this is how I really feel. I’m glad I can come tell you guys and you can see my personality and see this is really Lil B. This is what he wants. Regardless of what anybody says, I want all of you to live as long as possible, have a great, healthy life, fun, full of adventure, full of mystery, full of trials and tribulations. Just going through and seeing things, being able to forgive
Test your friends. See who really loves you. Remember that. See who will be with you forever. Just see. Take some time out for yourself. A lot of people miss communication. Friendships are such deep things that sometimes people tangle the friendship. People are like, “Well, I knew this person since I grew up, but this person’s a douche. You feel me? But I’ll still be his friend. But it’s like, we don’t agree. But it’s like, I have some weird thing in my head so I’ll still be your friend.” But be honest with yourself. Be around people who represent you, who you feel is on the same kind of monotone, you feel me? Who’s on your wavelength. I love y’all. Hopefully, everybody in this building is on the same wavelength, you feel me. You guys are very brave and historical and legendary, like I said, so I know everybody is on a wavelength. I’m looking at everybody and I know we could chill and we could have some good stories
What are some of the things that y’all be feeling? What are some of things that y’all are going through?  You know we ain’t gonna pull that dance out man! That’s millions, billions! I’m feeling like Michael Jackson out there, whipping the wrist like br-br-br-da! But I’m too subtle now. We representing. I got this beautiful quilt. I would’a come up here in a suit so y’all could take me seriously. I take y’all so seriously. I take the based god seriously
This is about me spreading my love to y’all. This is about saying how much I love you guys. How much I love being alive. How much I love human beings. How lucky we are to have this structure. Who built this? Tell me who built this building, please. Just going through New York you see just, wow, you have so much beautiful architecture. It’s so rich. When I look at the buildings, I’m like, dude, everybody is lucky. This might not be here forever. Anything could happen. Take heed, you guys are lucky you’re alive. Really, take heed. Can I hear you say, I’m lucky I’m alive! No, really, please, can you feel it? I’m lucky I’m alive!
Real talk: Don’t ever deny the voices in your head either. When you’re sitting at home alone, right, we all go through depression, anxiety. You’re by yourself and you hear those voices going wild in your head, in your unconscious, those angels by your side, your mental, your gut feeling, your heart. Listen to them. Let your mind tell you how you feel. Let your body tell you. Be in tune with your rare—this is a very rare thing. I’m like a robot. Hey look, tell your hand to do this. . It’s like, man, that’s amazing! That’s amazing to me
Hey, man, salute to all the beautiful doctors, everybody that’s researching and helping find cures. Salute to everyone who’s finding cures to diseaaaases. Everybody that’s aiding the people. The silent, beautiful American people that are working hard daily. Thank you to everybody. Honestly, a lot of people deserve to be where I’m at. There’s a lot of people that’s legendary, and to all those people I love you
 Ay, I don’t know man. But you know, I have nothing to hide either. I might run for president because y’all know everything about me. Look, my very smart NYU family, I tell you, I have nothing to hide and y’all shouldn’t either. Don’t let other people’s stereotypes or stigmas or words put you in a box. Don’t let that run your day. Don’t be depressed anymore. Believe in yourself. Sometimes you look at yourself in the mirror like, “Ew, really?” For real. I went to the mirror, man, I’m like, “Damn. How? How am I succeeding?” Y’all make me feel gorgeous, but sometimes you go to the mirror like, “Oh my god, I’m not that gorgeous.” But it’s all from your heart though, and that’s why you can always feel gorgeous, one hundred percent. To say “I’m not that gorgeous” is only a reflection of the media. You are gorgeous. I’m telling you. You are what you believe you are. You are a model. You are a rapper. You are a student. You are a positive person. Don’t let these words feel like you’re different. Nobody is different, I’m telling you, and nobody asked to be born. I’m telling you, bro, I’m telling you. I’m telling you
Shouts out to Jay-Z, though. Shouts out to Jayyyy-Zeeeee, you feel me?
Does anybody have anything to ask me? I say this, though, out of respect: You see everybody raising their hand, right? Just me personally, when I’m driving, I see somebody raising their hand and my whole attitude of respect is to let this person go. That’s my reaction. You see somebody raising their hand? Here you go. Just that vibe, just that tone. We all got our hands raised and we all want to talk, so let that person talk and you’ll be next. I feel everybody can do it civilized
I just want people to see the tone of respect I’m carrying, the love and respect I’m trying to instill for the generations. I don’t have no secret plan behind it. I generally want to bring back the people, all of us loving each other. We all human, we all people. Have fun while you’re alive. God bless, we’re all about to die some day. Be ready. I just want to say, humbly think about this. Our bodies are amazing. We’re all consistently—our white warrior blood cells, our red blood cells, everybody is fighting for us in our body and we don’t see. Salute to our brain and our cells fighting for us, fighting off those infections when you rub your butt and you forget to—when you’re writing a paper and you wipe your butt and you go to shake your partner’s hand. Wash your hands! Wash your hands! It’s crazy! I’m watching my hands all the time, shouts out to Sam for that
At the end of the day, we can’t judge anybody. From the richest to the homeless, from the dog to the cat. You have to look at these things. I thank my car that I didn’t get into an accident. I’m like, thank you. Brand new. Nothing I drive is under 50,000 miles. 50, 50, 50,000, bro. Straight from Europe. I tell you, I’m Buick’d up. Toyota, whatever. We doing it. But like I say, I thank my car. Thank you whoever, whatever, earth, spirit, myself, people. I’m like, man, I got from point A to point B safely. Congratulations to everybody getting here safely, man, I’m telling you. And shouts out to New York for always embracing me. Always. Because, man, coming from Berkeley
Being in this industry, man, you guys have got to watch out. In business, there are going to be a lot of people. This is crazy and I’m going to tell it to you like this, this is what I really live by. I run my business by this. You see a lot of people—and I cannot STAND these kind of people, I promise you—they’re like, “Ah, man, it’s just business. Business is business. It’s business.” It’s like, what are you talking about? Have some people love! What happened to humans? Everybody’s thinking about capital gains! Ay, bruh, I’m serious. I’m like, dude, I’m hollering at somebody because I do this out of love. I do this for free, for the love. Y’all make me. The people make me. I been giving you stuff free, over two thousand songs. Lil B. I’m around my business different. It’s business, but do what you love. If you want to do something out of love and the spirit, do something because your heart tells you that. Do something, not because, oh, it’s a business, oh, beat me in the business, I’m going to do this favor because it’s the business, I’m not going to pay attention to you because it’s the business, I’m going to treat you unequal because it’s the business, or I’m going to treat you some way because it’s the business. What happened to being a naked human being? Even though we’re not. We’re advanced now, like you see. It’s obvious we’re not naked
Salute to the architects, man, anybody that’s designing things. Anybody in here designing anything? Salute to you, bruh. Build some of the next beautiful buildings. Thank you. So what’s everybody doing up in here? What you going here for? I know we got a lot of future legends? Congratulations! Salute yourself! Be happy! Talk about yourself! And you know on top, this is one of the best schools ever
Salute to the generation and to all our kids that are just going to be friends. I can’t wait for all of our kids. We about to grow up, 50, 40, and we’ll be looking at people with no boundaries, no colors, no judgement. I’m a really do this: I want to have a place where you can come. It’s going to be like a city. You can come and it’s like, bruh, everybody is on the same wavelength of positivity. You see somebody? Let them go. Ask somebody how they’re doing today. I had to train myself to do that. I didn’t just become a happy person, you feel me. I had to train myself. I lied to myself for a while. I had to train myself, because I wasn’t always positive. I think I was so busy trying to be cool. Being younger, I was skinny and stuff, I was like, I need to garner my respect in the streets. I didn’t want to get picked on, so it was things I did that I felt were necessary. You grow up and you’re like, man, I was just so wrapped up. Be yourself. I was wrapped up in friends and wanting to be this and wanting respect. This was young. It’s crazy what goes on. You see the cool guys, or in high school it’s the bad kids. Everybody has their adventure
I was a product of the media and my environment. I seen the people I like with gold teeth, and I was like, man, I want gold teeth. He looked like me and I wanted gold teeth. Everybody can get a grill in here. Everybody should embrace that. Get gold teeth! Don’t be thinking so hard, like, “Oh, man, I can’t get gold teeth.” Who is going to say what to you? We got love in our heart. We good people. Can’t nobody tell you nothing if you doing it from the love and you’re embracing people. Try to have fun and try to be as less ignorant as possible and meet people. I’m trying to set a tone for the younger generations. You can look how you want, but now you will be judged from your soul and your heart. Why I work everyday and why I love you guys so much is I want people to no longer, as hard as it is, to not judge somebody for the look but from their heart and their actions and their positivity and how much they put out there. Even if you’re pissed off, still stay positive. If you got a friend doing bad, be like, “Stay positive.” That’s the only way. Positivity, happiness, forgiving, forgiving, forgiving
Forgiveness? Forgiving. I think that’s number one. Forgive and say, “Man, we only human. Man, nobody hates you.” We might feel that people hate us, and people do mean. But I go to sleep every night and I feel good, despite the hate every day and the threats. You take a deep breath and you know what you’re doing it for. We’re all searching life for how we can serve humanity. What are we going to do that we can do for free for the rest of our lives and feel good about? How are you going to serve the humans?
You know how I serve humanity? Spreading true love. Putting myself out there to be vulnerable, to be criticized, to be one of the most critiqued artists ever. They’re like, brrrr, Lil B said this at this time. Lil B is talking here. It’s beautiful, and I want to give this scarf to somebody too. And real talk, I want to give some books to the beautiful students that made this happen. I’ve got a few of my rare books. It’s love, bro. Shouts out to Seb. I see you. This is the first book I ever wrote when I was 19. We got the positive DVD in there. You already know me because you’re seeing me right now. You guys see my true core. It’s not sketchy. It’s no fraud. It’s no corporation backing me. I really love people, I’m really here for the people. I don’t care. It’s not gimmicks. I pick and choose what I want to do. I deny a lot of people and I love it, I stay rare. Nobody will ever work with Lil B and that’s how it goes
I’m ready to die for the humans. I’m ready to die for positivity. I’m ready to be the poster. A lot of hip-hop artists don’t understand the position they’re in. They be like, “Bruh, I’m not a role model.” And me, I feel totally different. I feel like I am a role model, and we all are. We all role models. Without y’all, it’d be no me. As a role model with the power influence, whether it’s Twitter followers or friends, you always want to use your influence for positive things. Put down the guns. Please stop the gun violence. Stop the knife violence. The chemical warfare, let’s stop that. Biological warfare, let’s stop that. Who knows about hydraulic fracking? Let’s stop fracking! Hey, bruh, stop messing with the earth, bruh. Real talk, we hear about these deadly gases going on in the earth, and I’m like, whodie! For real. I’m like, whodie. Whodie, get that oil out the ocean, whodie
I see what we’re living in. We were all born into something. You have to salute the humans before us, right. I have no problem and no animosity because we’re in a beautiful place. Imperfections, duh, nothing is perfect, but this is beautiful right here. This moment. We gotta be happy about something. Everything is not going to be right, but we gotta be happy about something right now. It’s continuous life living, continuous rotations of life living. Like I said, stop messing with this earth. I’m going to be going in and learning new ways to protect the earth. Trust me, I don’t even litter. I’m not a litterer. You see me and I’m not throwing trash on the ground. If I throw this trash right here, this is just adding for someone to pick up. This is just adding for some animal to get stuck in. At the end of the day, it all starts from you
I had to take steps myself for people to believe in me. I had to be a walking light of spiritual positivity and a walking beam of love before anybody could respect that, you feel me? It’s a big thing like, people call me the based god out of respect. People aren’t stupid. People here are a high class of honor, and people from the highest class call me the based god. The based god came from positivity and love and from watching out for people. I take that with heed. When people call me the based god, I accept me, but I’m not the based god. The based god is better than me. It’s crazy, you know. It’s crazy. But we all got a hand in love. One by one, each and every one of us needs to keep living and embedding that positivity. Look at that person. They didn’t ask to be born, they didn’t ask to be who they are. It’s like, man, embrace their style. Look at somebody and be like, “Man, they’re unique. But how are we similar? What is our commons?”
My grammar and spelling and how I say things might not be technically what we hear or textbook, but as long as you understand me? You have to work as a human with empathy and love in your heart, staying positive and staying based and staying normal. You have to make an effort to learn about people. You have to make an effort at your job. You have to make an effort to care. When you care about everybody genuinely, when you look at everybody like they’re a million dollars, it takes a lot of energy out you. You give everybody a chance. This is the successful lifestyle of personal excellence. Success is what you see on the outside, but I live a life of personal excellence. People can look at a Bentley as success or money as success, but at the end of the day personal excellence is what you strive for. Everybody is successful, we all made it. Y’all are in college. But now it’s about going back
I have no pride. I have no pride issues. I have no pride. I can’t be under as well as be on top, and that’s for the people. That’s why I never signed a deal. I’m unsigned. I have no record label behind me. When you see everything I do, this is me pushing my love. It was a lot of managers and fake managers that wanted to claim me, and you have to watch out for the industry predators, and predators in business. And sexual predators. We’ve dealt with that. It’s a very touchy subject and it’s very uncomfortable for all of us. Anybody who has went through hardships like that, I love y’all, and the best I can tell y’all is to forgive. Cleanse your soul and forgive yourself. Don’t be hard on yourself
I don’t write my speeches. Any time I speak it will be from the heart. You can’t write down love. If I was a phony man, y’all could look me in my face, man. If I didn’t have love, and if I didn’t really care about the community and wanting people to excel—I want all of us as a human race to excel and stop being so hard on each other. Stop using separation. Stop saying, “Why are you dressed like that?” What are you talking about? Like, stop. If someone looks different from you, admire them. Stop thinking so hard about things. Have a light heart. Get lighthearted. I think that’s a big tone of what I pray for everybody in the building and in our anything-is-possible generation. Just be you. The anything-is-possible generation. What is based? What does based mean? Shwoo. Shwoo. Shwoo
[Audience member asks about the status of The Pack You know, I’m one hundred percent still in The Pack. We coming, man. Shouts out to Young L, Stunnaman, Lil Uno. We coming, you know. Naw, we coming. With me just making history, the people really wanted me. The people made me. That was my only reason. I been giving you guys free stuff. You don’t have to listen to me. You don’t have to watch me. I’m not on TV every day. I’m about to be. But right now I’m not. You guys are the beautiful people. You are the beautiful people for accepting me. My mom would be happy, and I really appreciate that. You guys have made me special, and in return you will always get my genuine love and consideration. I’m not perfect. I get mad sometimes. I deal with people that threaten me. I have to protect myself. Everybody know: Protect Lil B. Protect the based god. There’s only one me. I promise you, nobody has done what I’ve done in history. From being the first artist ever to release an ambient album in history with no cursing, Rain in England. Love is strange
 It was great. It was an honor working with Wayne. Me and him was in the studio man, I was really nervous.  Yes, sir, I definitely hear you. Can I continue? Can I finish? Or do you…? Okay. No, no, this is just me being considerate. He is a man. It was amazing in that studio. Shouts out to Mack Maine. Shouts out to Birdman on the real, bruh. Working with Wayne and seeing how much love he had for me, to see him embracing me like family is so good. That ain’t the only track we got in store. And you guys are going to freak out, because, real talk, I got a song with pretty much the biggest artist on earth. You will see. Phwoo, we coming. I’ll let you know some history with me towards the end. Anything else?
 I definitely do, man. My mom was a painter. Ay, bruh, feel me. But you know what I do rock with? My favorite is watercolors. I’m a watercolors type of dude, so definitely collect some of my rare paintings
 Well, you guys are actually the first to hear, but I’m releasing my rock album. Pretty much. Regardless me selling platinum records or me going gold or nothing, I already made history in rap. Nobody has ever done what I’ve done. So with that, out of respect for people, I’m not just some joke. I’m not some rapper who’s going to make some joke rock album. This is going to be real respect. This is going some garage punk. This is going to be for the rebels. And the women and the ladies, we about to be having a real good time. But look out for my Lil B rock album, California Boy. We made history NYU because y’all are the first people to hear that. I’m shutting it down. It’s about to be a celebration for all of us. Thank you for believing me, because this rock album is about to go down in history. On everything
 I love you. Thank you family. I love you man. Respect knowledge. If you see somebody with gray hair, embrace that beauty. Show the world that we are beautiful! That was me trying to get everybody to rally. Show the world we’re beautiful! I’m out here getting my Mitt Romney on. Show the world we’re beautiful! I better not talk about Mitt or you might not see me. What happened to Lil B? Lil B is in jail. Why is he in jail? Imprisoned by the government. Lil B made jokes about Mitt Romney at NYU and he’s in prison for some reason. But what was you saying about your mother? You just wanted to tell me that? I appreciate you, and thank you. I just want to tell her I love her, and I want to tell her congratulations for making it so far on earth. Serious, serious, serious. Congratulations to her and I pray she stays alive longer, bro. We all not going to have our parents forever, so I’m glad you’ve got her right now
 I’m not here to capitalize on people. I only do what I really love. I got full control of this. I know people want to buy stuff from me, and I know a lot of people are buying other clothing lines thinking they’re me. So anybody you’re buying, you’re supporting them, and that’s good. Support humans. I put out money. I spend my money in America because this is our money. I’m about to pay taxes, and I’m happy because of that. I’m happy. I don’t know what it’s going for, and I pray it’s going to the people. The government says that and I’m going to give them the benefit of the doubt. But, hey, look, anybody is smart and has some facts, let me know. But until further notice, I’m paying taxes and I’m loving it. You’ve gotta buy people dinner. Never deny your friends food. If your friends are hungry, at least give them food
 You guys. It’s you, bruh. Being here, we could be brothers now. It’s good, regardless. And everybody, speak both languages too. Listen to slang. Slang is like learning another language. Be bilingual and go learn some slang. For sheezy! Brang dang dang. If you know some slang, rep that. You feel me? You feel me?! Yeah, bruh. Use swag, yeah, dummy
 That’s one of the only people in rap I’m listening to. A lot of people aren’t original. Shouts out to my bro Drake. My brother Drake, I love him. Everybody is rapping like him and I love him. I respect artists. You gotta be yourself. Let my brother Drake have his swag. Let Lil B have his swag
 Shouts out to Rap Genius, man. If anybody has any questions about my lyrics, I would love to spit a cappella. If you ever want me to decode my lyrics, if you ever have questions… Anybody got questions?
 Salute to the family. I stay by that. That’s my brother right there. His hand is gold
Alright, y’all, so we’re about to wrap up. I want to take pictures with y’all for Facebook and Twitter. Let’s take these rare pictures real quick and we’ll get up out of here. Illo, esto es una mierda: cuando lo ensayas sale bien
Y cuando coges y empiezas a grabar en el móvil

Real west coast shit, run like the Taliban
The AK cost 2800 like Stunnaman
Put a sucka nigga on stage like Summer Jam
Gun got all peanut butter, I don't ever jam
You living in Neverland, bitch you never ever can
You rap niggas got no legs cause you never ran
On the top floor, 4 5's like the Son of Sam
Really wanna battle Lil B? That's 100 grand
And you ain't got 100 grand, I eat you for the motherland
Don't ever speak what Lil B speak, he the man
Feel like the head chief with my tiny pants on
Let me remind you niggas bitch I made the Vans song
Shouts out to Wolfpack, still a young nigga man
Know I never leave where we started: bro I promise that
Only time I leave is when bitch niggas start to infiltrate
Throw it in the air and you looking like a dinner plate
Man I'm so hungry that my bones showing through my face
Damn near robbed my own bitch for a better space
Loyalty ain't shit now, I'm searching for the real shit
That two Twin Tower earthquake type of real shit
Don't gotta deal with still grind type of real shit
The only real niggas like me spit that ill shit
OK, you niggas want me to stop that pretty bitch shit?
But y'all can't fuck with me, be that pretty bitch then
I don't say "homo" cause I'm a fucking thug
Should've been TLC: you a fuckin scrub
Don't understand me, I don't understand me
I'm the only rapper that can do what I wanna do
I'm the only nigga that can say what I wanna say
All these other niggas getting booed like OJ
I respect OJ, a fan of the Juiceman
Knew about Kool Keith, I listened to the Roots, man
Niggas say what they wanna say about Lil B
Til you get the fame and respect, it don't mean a thing
G get the car and the house boy it's all a dream
Feel like Malcom X and think I'm Martin Luther King
Bitches think I'm Big Meech, rawest rapper in the game
If you say "Lil B sucks" you're a fuckin' lame
I don't want awards and I don't want the fuckin' like
I think I'm The Source so I gave myself Five Mics
Niggas in jail waiting on to get their next kite
Only time I'm in jail a sucka try to take my life
Understand boy I just turned positive
Woke up today and I seen what my options is
And I know about these fake niggas
Infiltrate the game and I show you haters shake niggas
I am the earth so you are what you eat
Every rapper in the game gettin ate by Lil B
You nigga's disagree, well put it on the record
And you nigga's ain't ready it's like you on the summer league
I rap man I feel like I coach a team
Mo' money mo' problems it's the same thing
Real nigga definition you a fake nigga
Tattoos ain't shit but a lil bit of paint nigga
Remember that when you go and get your new tat
You do it for the bitches, I do it cuz I had to rap
Remember go get your education
We playing in the game where the judge by your races
That's why sometimes people getting faceless
Trying to look like what they did in the Matrix
Man it's finna be a cold summer
Only got one friend
Coyote and the Roadrunner
All you rap nigga's tryin' to rap like Drake now
And he a good dude but shit I'm a hood nigga
People shitted on my life for as long as I could imagine
Listen to DMX depressed while I'm rapping
Changes going through my body man hood came fast puberty right beside it
But ask me why I stay writing
To release like I'm acting, contract my notepad
Anything remembered
Remember me as a legend that never took no for an answer
Strive for the dreams, that move around like dancers
Look into myself for the answers
Newborn child in my arms, see the light
Another chance given at life
Let's make it right
Lead the world, stop the fighting
Lil B
BitchWatch out, I'm a bad motherfucker
And if you don't I might have to bust ya
I come from Berkeley
Where motherfuckers put you on a shirt G
And don't think nothing 'bout it
Everybody in the club gettin' rowdy
It's nobody like me
Everybody in the world gettin' hyphy

We don't like broke bitches where I'm from
Ring-to-the-ding-dong

Shout out North Oakland
At Bushrod, bitch, and we smokin'
And shout out my cousin
Cause everybody know that I love him
I must be a rap star
Everywhere I go I'm ridin' in the fast car
I don't do interviews
Cause every time I talk, nigga, I make the news
And that's non-fiction
You can tell how the fuck that I'm livin'
And this is how I'm reppin'

It's your boy Lil B Red Flame Mixtape, this the intro
If you didn't get Blue Flame go get that to understand this
It's done, rap game's done
My nigga told me if I ever stop rapping
The game lost Jordan, trade him to the Magic
Exhibit Based not Exhibit C
You niggas couldn't see, let me part the sea
Part a part of me, nothing pardons me
You niggas arguably is worse than me
Meet the whole squad, let me go hearse your team
Pop bullets in his back make him work his knees
This is sick I'm on top now
I remember in the hood I was locked down Oakland, Yosemite
Having YA dreams the pen right ahead of me
Glad I didn't let a few suckas get ahead of me
Now I guarantee that they never be forgetting me
Like a hard drive man it's all about the memory
Strapped with a vest screaming' mutherfuck my enemies
Haters fuck around I start moving like a centipede
I'm the weed-man so you know I got the remedy
Plus I'm a user, dope-fiend music
Plus I'm a robber and I dare you suckas push me
Got the same pistol that they shooting in Blue Streak
Riding Aston Martin new suede with the blue seats
Then I ride Toyota, hit the hood solo
Doing dirt solo I'll tee like Mobo
Got the piece like po-po, spreading peace like grown folks
My mom should be proud of me
I don't know but I'm feeling like she doubting me
Real nigga shit everybody hating on me
And you don't know about these handles
Most of my songs now I gotta set examples
Growing up, I was always the one to have trouble with the ones that was never growing up
Now we grown up and they never going up I swear to god that's the type of shit that make me go nuts
Age 16 I was stealing out trucks
Had music in the deck, had zips in the trunk
Right before class popping bottles getting drunk
Never been a driver, never had a license
Walked in my house and it was smelling like incense
Bringing home DVD players and TV's
Give em to my Mom as presents for creating me
And you knowing that I love ya in the hood I'm like Peter Pan passing out hundreds
No hate in my heart, I was passing out money
17 I been fucking stunting
Before I was a rapper, I was just a trapper
Don't trap the real and I used to have a ski-mask
Never rob the family, never rob the innocent
Never rob a nigga who you cool and who you kicking with
Bringing back the G-code these niggas started breaking it
How you making death threats to niggas who was making it
At your house mad and you really started hating em
Want to be the hero but you never really taking shit
Fuck around with me I leave your ankles split
Desert Eagle grip  with extended clips, wishing death to enemies
You hate on me, you a fake nigga
You a fake nigga like Ricki Lake nigga
Heart and soul of a cold-blooded killer
But my spirit too pure I had to shower in the river
And bless my heart I'm a visionary
Speak in 3rd person, cause it's the only one in the city
I'm the greatest rapper alive, Lil B I'm the rawest rapper
Greatest to ever do it 
And I don't know how I survived my childhood
A lotta letters and the judge show a lot of love
PO hate still do a lot of drugs
Violate a couple times now I understand
You would act like my friend and send me to the pen
Not the pen juvenile hall like a gym
Start my day man I'm really nice with the pen
Our world ain't the same
I'm thinking hitman out nigga waiting in the trees
If he's relevant, I'mma make him Oddjob
I got the goldeneye, I got the Golden gun
I'm on the jet-skis no I'm not James Bond
Split a nigga wig make him think that he James Bond
If I ain't James Bond, bet I got the same gun
Plus I got money in the bank for the bail-bond
Pay him 80 G's if he thinking he can tell on
No witness make him run like Rev Run
No blood in his jeans  like a stepson
Yeah I got 45's I'm traveling to India
I'm finna have 10 kids it's my millennium
Everything Lil B, everything Based God
Berkley like Gotham City, hitman is the Joker
Best friend Two-Face
Who do I approach when I move at night, like Batman
Show my respect with my right hand
Solid? eye contact, hip-hop notepads I bring it full contact
Really in the hood and I do it no contracts
And I won't eat pussy eating bitches like blunt-wraps
When you see me, it's like you seen a holy ghost
Put the nine in his mouth nigga like french toast
My niggas, we do it real extra-big
Wanna book Lil B that's G's
Start to see life real like my last name
LIL B THAT PRETTY BITCH RUN THE RAP GAME
Hey Just Blaze come holla at me man, come fuck with the greatest bruh
Lil B, rawest rapper alive can't nobody fuck with me
Hey, um, Jay Electronica I'm sorry I had to do thatYeah see, Brandon, fool, I told you, we gotta go over some hard beats, this time
Nate, Nate, Nate Fox
We 'bout to get fucked, fucked up
They said fuck us, for real?
We don't play that shit, for real
Been in the same place
For way too long
Been in the same state
I can't do that shit
I get used to it
Then I think it's some usual shit
Usually I'm too, too lit
Problems meet you in tune to it
I get fucked up and I intend to be
Sending me, off
Where am I meant to be?
Historical problems, I think I know that
I can not go back
Simba is stuck in a jungle tonight and I want to be
Regular as a one, two, three
And the 3/4th time sig
Don't talk about my cig
Or my sit-uation
Don't talk about, I'm lit
Don't talk about, shit that I did like last week
You suck
I don't got a problem
I tried to solve them
'Til I realized, that's me, me, me, me
Four walls, that's me, me, me, me
Everything's so theatrical
So magical
Super fantastical
Super fragital
I mean, fragile
I'm agile
I'm agile, know I keep going on, on it
It's just us, just trust
It must, get better
Than it used to be
One, two, three
Click, click, I'm back at the crib
Back on my shit, back on my shit
I saved the city with two fans and fists
No more, unjist, or unjust situations
What happened to my bros?
What happened to my bros?
You know that we grow up
A growth spurt from the toes
To the tip of the head
I got some longer legs
I been growing, my stride just get stronger
And when I walk into this shit
It's like God is my...on the side of my ear
And I watch him talk into this shit
I can't get into this shit
But understand that I'm blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
God just say, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Tell me what I need to
Me too, I got people I need to feed too
You feel me, I'm on my own
]
Feed too 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got people to feed too
Some people to lead through
How could I not see you?
I just gotta see it through
Like I'm the jacker
But I'm just backed up
With a lot of filled up space
I got no space on my hard drive
Sometimes my life flies
Sometimes I can't see at night
I just wanna see inside
I just wanna float away
I just wanna fly away
My name's Lil B
But what if I die today?
Would they remember me?
Would I be history?
Would I be everything?
And Everything that I wanted to see
And wanted to be
And wanted to throw out the window
The window, I live for, I see through
I see you, can't see those
I don't feel them
And no, I don't hear them
I can't smell them
And I'd rather not be around them because they're jealous
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, they're jealous
Jealous, Based freestyle
Based freestyle, and the melon
My melon, my melanin is melling
I'm like a melon
I'm like a watermelon
Because I just spit out the seeds
But sometimes they can not see me
So I gotta roll, gotta go
To the top of the space, and I gotta float
I gotta row like I'm on a rowboat
Going through the mountain, top of those
And I'm going through the water
And sometimes I'm going farther
And sometimes I'm doing short strokes
But I'm still on this boat
And bitch, where's my life vest?
I'm so stressed
And where's the top thing that I can breathe through
To resusc-itate-t-t-tate me
T-t-take me, I want to be free, fr-fr-free me
But with you Lil B, I am the history
I-i-i-i s-s-s-stutter
Because I'm s-s-s-scared of me
This is all August, all this, all of that, and
Shouts out to Chance the Rapping...he really raps that, raps that
Let's wrap it up, we gonna keep rapping up
It's your boy Lil B, I don't rap enough
Beautiful music, lifetime music,  epic proportions
Epic music, sometimes you can just see it and you feel it
Understand it, living life
Doing what's right
Every day, every night
Chance The Rapper what's up man?
Let's go
Uh, uh, cause I'm looking at the window
Outside view, I can see them
But I can't see through
But I gotta see it through, like the jacker said
Keep everything positive, it be in my head
All my chance, it's not on me it's in me
So, we don't want no frenemies
Just real friends, and a table of wines
Who we can sip away, and think about the shine
And the grace, the grace, the grace, the grace
The grace, the grace, the grace, the grace
]

Haters don't say my name but its one of they nieces
Came a long way from tucking heat under the fleeces
Man they sleeping on the boss but I'm seeing their features
Can't look me in the eyes cuz the stares is cold
I'm so cold like the ice that was made in snow
Heart burn like a match set the game on fire
Lil B for Lil Boss when I come be fired
Man the dro burn slow off the blunt I'm higher
15 I was living every mans desire
Came straight out the hood with the peon vest
I throw shots like a beast so I'm Ron Artest
When I fire off my gun bet my arm don't rest
Sending money through the wire like I'm Kanye West
I bounce back double up that was all I get
Smooth dude real goon that was smooth as piss
Can't stop what you can't see word to my dick
Eating salad everyday thinking that I'm rich
Dress her up break it down cuz she really a bitch
Can't trust them in the game cuz they really a snitch
Where your heart at we coming from the bottom where the dark at
Crabs in the bucket so they mad when you spark that
So I gotta spark back
The pump make your head shake
The 45 bullets go dumb like the dread check
Infrared beam on your head thats the lead-weight
Cock thing back and make hell then the jailbreak

A lot of dudes say hey and they really don't like me
Cuz I fuck your main bitch and I ain't even be icy
2 chains 4 rings goddamn thats pricey
Feel asleep on first class eating chicken on planes
Getting off the planes seeing limousines and the ranges
How I calculate my life shit, its life and the pain
Staying wet, staying fresh, forever its raining
Goddamn I'm god so you can't contain em
The only thing stopping me is my face
I look in the mirror I see a person that I could never disgrace
Before I'm in the streets homeless I would catch me a case

Devil in my eyes, you can see him when we slide
Pistol on my side, I can't let 'em kill my vibe
Niggas pickin' sides and these niggas switchin' sides
I promise I'ma ride
We tread spin, bullets flyin'
Even at the red light, his mama still can't stop from cryin'
If my chain fell out my pocket the only way I drop a dime
I know Ray Charles had it good, he ain't never had to see a homicide
Stevie Wonder ain't see his brothers die, he ain't feel my pain
He don't know my mama couldn't pay the light bill and I felt that pain
But Mark had died, he wasn't breaking a dollar, but I tried to help him change
Interrogatin', I still wouldn't crack if I was on cocaine
Got this shit from out the projects, ain't no silver spoons
The morning after the night we slide only time we watch the news
I wanna comment on niggas' picture, but I just keep it cool
I know them pussy niggas bitches, and they know it too, that's why I'm confused
I was stackin', gettin' money when I was in school
Went to sellin' packs from jackin', then made rappin' cool
Lookin' up to rich niggas, let me rock they jewels
Got the game from real steppers, that's why I walk with tools
Never let these bitches knock me off my pivot, spin 'em
DM her best friend, I'm tryna get up in her, kill it
Rapping like an expert but I just be doin' it to blow off in it
Two thousand on all my denim, I'm always working, I'm never chillin'
Made a killing off a killing, put a million on his head
Gotta look out for his children, he got picked up by the feds
Give a fuck 'bout he say, she say, I don't wanna hear about what they said
And G5 just said he brought the pints, I'm through with sippin' red
I'ma ride for my niggas, wrong or right
Devil in my eyes, you can see him when we slide
Pistol on my side, I can't let 'em kill my vibe
Niggas pickin' sides and these niggas switchin' sides
I promise I'ma ride
We tread spin, bullets flyin'
Even at the red light, his mama still can't stop from cryin'
If my chain fell out my pocket the only way I drop a dime
I know Ray Charles had it good, he ain't never had to see a homicide
I come from the bottom like the curb do
Got 'em in they feelings, it's so personal
Ride with that fire, can't let 'em swerve you
Gotta watch your own back, can't let 'em hurt you, haha
Shooters on the roof that'll murk you
And I, treat 'em like my son, like I birth you
When I was runnin' through the street, it was on curfew
And all them times I had him down, I could've murked you
Before I went and did my time in the feds
I was skippin' school that's why I was upset
I was trappin' on Sunset on the hill, I couldn't beg
Keep that fire by my side, yeah, you know I ain't scared, yeah
You know how I play it
I'ma ride for my niggas, wrong or right
Devil in my eyes, you can see him when we slide
Pistol on my side, I can't let 'em kill my vibe
Niggas pickin' sides and these niggas switchin' sides
I promise I'ma ride
We tread spin, bullets flyin'
Even at the red light, his mama still can't stop from cryin'
If my chain fell out my pocket the only way I drop a dime
I know Ray Charles had it good, he ain't never had to see a homicide
Hit a one way, went to leave school, that's the only way to go
We stopped goin' to football practice, we found another way to score
See I'm tired of seein' my niggas in dirt, but they ain't from Chicago
And Billy died sober shootin' dice, hear what I'm sayin', I'm hollow
And my niggas went to snortin' coke, I remember pourin' up in Fanta
Asking God why that cat geeked, I don't never get no answers
I be wantin' to get my bros out that slammer, but they ain't like Tyson Chandler
They play with it, we gon' knock they lights out, watch 'em put down candles, hah
I'ma ride for my niggas, wrong or right
Devil in my eyes, you can see him when we slide
Pistol on my side, I can't let 'em kill my vibe
Niggas pickin' sides and these niggas switchin' sides
I promise I'ma ride, yeahI got trees on deck

But I'm talking as if I am the hood, check me out:
Most of it so real I can't even explain

People walkin on my face, drug dealers in vain
Cars drivin on my heart, people spittin on me
Every time the earth shake is when you feeling me speak
I don't try to talk too much, but the feeling is deep
Things I see every day make me crack open
Dope dealers sold rock, say the crack open
I done watch em grow up claiming West Oakland
People building houses on my stomach
Not enough structures, so sometimes I vomit
Break the house slowly, not stable enough
Young thug killed his friend cause he jealous and dumb
I done watched him rape girls cause they hand him a gun
Blood splatter on my face now my face is numb
Yeah, now my face is numb
Police comin by with the tape and cameras
Lost too many men to the tape and cameras
You would think how many died it would set an example
But nobody even cared, just another example
Pourin liqour on my legs cause his partner is dead
Used to play with the white now it's liquor instead
One dude, named Dwight, had a car he drove on me
Every time he rolled up see his partners roll on him
I could tell that they didn't like that he was driving a Benz
Fake friends always hate when you driving to win
Dwight picked him up, wanted to give em a ride
Let em in the back seat, just so the feeling inside
He ain't tryna stunt on him, worked hard for his ride
Plus he wanted to show the leather and the heat in the side
They ain't understand the grind, they just seen his ride
So they shot him in the neck just for being inside
They was friends for 10 years but they greedy inside
Dwight fell out the car, he was bleedin, he died
They tried to switch the plates and the colour of the Benz
So they could stunt in front of hoes, show em money that they spent
They drove to the East for an even exchange
When the cops pulled up, it wasn't even exchanged
Pull em out the stolen car with the murderous weapon
Said you finnah go to jail with a murderous blessing
Every day is something, the weather doesn't help it
The heat make em pop off shots like B. Celtics
Bossin, every hood, always see the flossin
Seen the coke bosses, credit card bosses
Being in the hood I done traveled to the Slauson
Being on the turf I done seen em kill for colors
Watchin baby mothers without baby fathers
The kids are my soul, they walking on my fortress
Sitting on they porches, looking at surroudings
Never coming down, but the sun is coming down
And Gunshots wake when the last sun sleeps
I ain't never cried last time it was a hailstorm
Maybe it's an earthquake, better yet a snowstorm
If you get mad, everything that you know umm...
Only in the hood, nobody ever watch it
No money in it, so it's negative in profit
I need construction workers, only my doctors
City council gave me a couple more options
If I keep cracking they was gonna fix me
I speak for the block the rest of it was history

Mayne, real trap shit, like I said
Only goon nigga in these tiny pants
I shoulda been had this shit
TrapaholicsKeep your head up
It's real life
Keep your head up
I know your mom died and I feel your pain
That’s why I’m sitting in the dark sparking up this flame
And you lost your dad too
And he’s still a soldier
Please don’t let the grind stop
Know that life ain’t over
Seeing you cry some nights
With your head down
Hurt my heart like a stroke
That you go  unfed now
Don’t let the pain crush your mind
And yourself man
I’mma hold you down for real
It just crossed my mind
How the days pass when you’re not looking
But a death in your family got all the pictures crooked
Plus your grandma and your grandpa
Life is too short to be living with your head hung
Keep it up
Keep your head up
Know that you could make it
Brother didn’t snitch and he took that bid
He didn’t know what time was 'til he took that bid
Just look him in his eyes
Said two plus ten
I ain’t know what math was
But that’s two plus ten
No one asked why he felt that pain
Why he got so mad
Loaded up and cocked that back
Didn’t ask why he hit those licks
His whole family dying
Plus he scared that the drugs don’t mix
And he mad that the drugs exist
Whole family apart ‘cause the buzz is it
And they rather get high than to hug their kids
Man, I look him in his eyes and he hate that shit
I did this for you, bro
And everything is good
Someone love you
Lady from the hood
Swear she got no answer
Gotta raise three kids
But she got breast cancer
And we know rent due when the bank won’t answer
Wanna move out the hood and defeat that cancer
I ask how she stay on her feet like dancers
How she keep on adding paint to a life-size canvas
She told me every day that you must take chances
If you’re living in the past then there’s no enhancements
She said life’s hard but the dreams do matter
Only way to read books is if you move through chapters
She said spread love of pain and promise
And she died the next day
That’s what made me honest
It’s real life
Take everybody like they’re a million dollars
You never know
Girl Seventeen got to fix her posture
Always getting beat down by her deadbeat father
He’d say nice things
But it’d be so awkward
When he’d drink alcohol
Then he’d slap her mama
Now Girl Seventeen
Call men imposters
What he did to her mind caused way more drama
She walked out the house
Said no more drama
Had to fend for herself
So she stayed with partners
She met a nice dude and his name was Seante
And he ran a little game and proceed to boss her
Because she want a man nothing like her father
She would do anything for a dude that bothered
Seante made her start having sex for dollars
And it really hurt my heart every time I saw her
Deep down inside all she want is a father
So I never judge a book by its cover
Girl Seventeen having sex for hours
Staying up long nights
Even missed a shower
Had to deal with the pain off pills and powder
Taking long drives home on the road for hours
Sex with many men
Even dealt with cowards
Wouldn’t put the condom on
‘Cause he felt the power
Seante got sick, had to call the doctor
Said he didn’t feel well and his head was nauseus
Girl Seventeen, started to get real cautious
‘Cause Seante never said what was in that office
Seante came home looking like he lost it
So Girl Seventeen went to kiss him
He said, “Don’t touch me, I’m HIV positive”
Just make sure you use condoms
And never judge a book by its cover
That’s why, when I look at people now
I don’t know what they’re going through
You don’t know what anybody’s going through
So you gotta respect it
It's Lil B
All these are real stories
And I want to dedicate every verse to y'all
I know all of us can relate to this
Just let the beat cry for you, I'm crying for you
But I gotta let this song cryVerse 1:
Pull up on my block, with my gang, hit a stain
Get my 40 and I bang
Gotchu runnin like Usain
And I hit you in the brain, then you really feel the pain
Yeah
Shoutout to my haters
That's the reason for my fame
Verse 2:
Lil Baper is my name
Get you girl then I claim
Poppin glocks is my game
All you rappers sound the same
All this ice on my chain
Get my draco then I aimOh my God, oh my God, Lil B
