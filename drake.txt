Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that

Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me 
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me 
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
 She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section

Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
 I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I doI've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me

Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me

Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day

I came up, you changed up
I caught that whole play
Since, things never been the same
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake 
I don't trust a word you say 
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants

I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all 
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
Uhh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

I don't know, I'm delirious
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone

I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
Uh, cups of the XO

Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party

Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
"Well, I'm sorry"
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here, then
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy"

Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together

My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record

Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'

That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen

I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do
Yeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you doHow I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
I think I killed e'rybody
In the game last year, man, fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
At the strip club, mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, Big Tyme
"Sunshine," tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga – stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know itYeah
Wheezy outta here
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy

Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Wheezy outta hereLook, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around youThat's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? 
'Cause I'm up right now 
And you stuck right now 
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now? 
'Cause I'm up right now 
And you stuck right now, yeah 
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?
My heart belongs to you...
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? 
'Cause I'm up right now 
And you stuck right now 
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
Girl, how 'bout now? 
'Cause I'm up right now 
And you stuck right now, yeah 
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't doI can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded
Take a shot for me 
Take a shot for me 
Take a shot for me 
A shot for me 
A shot for me
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place; not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misin-terpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it
Take a shot for me 
Take a shot for me 
Take a shot for me 
A shot for me 
A shot for me
Yeah
May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accept youDon't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Yeah
It's a Habibis ting, ya?
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now
Hell nah

Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs 
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave

Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play 
God, the way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest 
I guess for the fuck shit, I'm biased 
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my mama out the basement 
That's a different type of face lift

More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shitOwn it
It's yours
It's yours
Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh

Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in, ha!
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it

You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna ride, fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back and never on the side, uh
You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it
Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me? I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private 
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided, tell me how you feel inside
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah

This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my voice
This song's for youI might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it , please don't do it 
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it 
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know
They know, they know, they know 
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, "Money over everything! Money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, "They miss the old Drake", girl don't tempt me
"If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do"
I'm like, "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know
They know, they know, they know 
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
I be yelling out "Money over everything!"
"Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!"
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel betterYeah
I'm working on dying
I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool
I'm upset 
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect 
So offended that I had to double check
You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex 
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck 
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? 
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul 
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho 
Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front 
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?
I'm upset 
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC 
But I'm blessed, I just checked 
Hate me, never met me in the flesh 
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left 
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul 
Thankful for the women that I know 
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoTake your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?

So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving this crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving this crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, "What?" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call

I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, fake
Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for the snakes, yeah
'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my bitches up
These niggas is pussier than what? All them dicks is up
All my real niggas down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up, rrrr
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the fuck is this bitch inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop "Another One", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
"Back to Back"? Me and Drizzy laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
I never signed a 360, bitch you wild dumb
That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury
I got before and after pictures of your surgery
Rah took you to her doc, but you don't look like Rah
Left the operating table, still look like "nah"
'Cause I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
Yeah, yeah, never been no fraud
Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, "What up, Killa?"
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that bitch up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
Uh, I am not a fraud, YM, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, "Alright, alright, alright"
I would let that little nigga right there fuck my wife, word
I don't need no fraud bitches in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, "Babe, I think I love you, kinda"
Feelin' like Tune-y Montana, Weezy, he get honored
Drake a headliner, and Nicki, she get finer, wordIt’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that. So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you...When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone differentI just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure 
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sureIt's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said "no strings attached" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
YeahYour heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus ChristSilence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More LifeI know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you 
I've loved and I've lost
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you 
I've loved and I've lost
Yeah
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you 
I've loved and I've lostIs it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
You'll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Dom Rosé toast

Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD

Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys

This is all God's doin', man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm Satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only twenty-nine, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga 
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more

'Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need

Isn't it amazing?
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends, if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby
Yeah, swanging
She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
I'll be here, just swanging
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good, girl, like you're famous
I know I'm late, it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girlI'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay
So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eat
Keep gettin' temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time
Y'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my name
And I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, "I'ma done him for you"
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to you
Considerin' that we just sold another 20 for you
To be honest
DuppyYeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same
Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken 
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen 
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do

Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah

'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

The concept of puttin' money first, boy 
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy 
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy 
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy 
I'll admit it, I'll admit it 
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business 
I'll admit it, I'll admit it 
Rolling swishers, hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it 
I'll admit it, I'll admit it 
You too worried 'bout the bitches 
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it 
She'll admit it, she'll admit it 
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished 
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy 
Shit hot up in the 6 right now
Shit hot up in the 6, boy 
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now 
Come see us and get it fixed, boy 
Black Benz on the road, boy 
Already had a Rolls Royce 
Sold a couple Bentley last week
Them were my old toys 
I give a fuck about old, boy 
I give a fuck about his squad, boy 
I give a fuck about your mob, boy 
I'm the real 6 God, boy 
I'm about to say a true thing 
I'm about to say a true thing 
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
Goddamn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
Yeah, so I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right nowYou my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like oh well
You're like, "Fuck it. Oh well"
My past behind me like a pony tail
But you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
Okay I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more Henny and you're past the limit
You told me 'bout the picture, now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never willStop, stop, stop…
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so and so’s that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin'
Trust me this information is vital
I’m tryin' to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!
Have you seen me?
I’m doing so good
Every time we meet:
"Oh, I’m so sorry."
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)
"You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak."Yeah, alright, yeah
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna 
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of usYeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though
Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?
Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeahI got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what? I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky, I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to
But we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin'
On some "why-you-love-these-strippers?" shit
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit, oh!
Oh, me, I don't deserve it 
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man, I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer
Hit me when you're done your shift, yeah
I need some company, I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby, heat baby
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby
I'm in heat baby...
Mo City trip! Mo City trip right now! Yeah
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
Ayy, ayy, a Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now, yeah
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm a dog
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby, heat baby
I'm a dog, I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off 
When she get too on, we take it off 
Drank so long, for a year I didn't cough 
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions 
Do you mind if we just menage just a little? 
Mo City trip right now, Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip right nowYeah
Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys-forever, hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga
Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch, check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, niggaYou've got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ahhhhhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is "Leave me alone"
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise 
They got me feelin' like the one again 
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wriPeople around you
Should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact
That you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends
That you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you
That you do the right thing, ooh
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say
Oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her
Already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
We musta been here before
It's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit
That somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too
We're perfect for each other
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say
Oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her
Already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
We musta been here before
It's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit
That somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper
And soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident
Tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed
To judge a book by it's cover
I don't wanna be in the blind
But sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it
If I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile
But I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic?
Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first
But it's better than your last; Tunechi
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
We musta been here before
It's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit
That somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote on quote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
'Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabiesYou know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best 
You the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best 
You the best I ever had , best I ever had 
Best I ever had , best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there 
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best 
You the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best 
You the best I ever had , best I ever had 
Best I ever had , best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best 
You the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best 
You the best I ever had , best I ever had 
Best I ever had , best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best , you the fuckin' best

She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it with for the drama?
I've got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me
Why you keep askin' me about... 
Couple other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now
Told you 'bout givin' him chances on chances on chances
He's not holdin' you down, he's holdin' you back right now
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh 
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me, oh

Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me
Yeah, ayy
Yeah
I I threw my hands in the air and said show me somethin', yeah
Ayy
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house
She made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "When that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' 'bout, "You gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley four-door already
Even as a boy, I was the boy already
So you know that that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy
You would prolly...
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy, yeahIt's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time 
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time 
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

Fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fuckin' someone else
Just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic, don’t I? I get it poppin’, don’t I?
I’ll end up stoppin', won’t I? And by the time I end up stoppin'
You’ll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out
While shoppin' with a nigga, don’t lie
She’s losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that you over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes: don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make
I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone

Won't stop, woah, yeah, never stop
Got so many opps, I be mistakin' opps for other opps
Got so many people that I love out of troubled spots
Other than the family I got, it's either you or me
That's just how I think, it's either you or me
This life got too deep for you, baby
Two or three of us about to creep where they stayin'

Basically, I'm sayin' either way we 'bout to slideCheck, one-two, one-two, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a
Not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games
'Cause they feel like they know me 
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed 
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game 
This ain't no motherfucking 91
We out here rapping for money, you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
You would think it's all mine the way I took it 
You would think it broke down the way I push it 
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't? 
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just tryna be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
You hit me like "I know you’re there with someone else" 
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio, so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text 
I want to get straight to the climax 
Yeah, have you coming all summer like a season pass 
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back 
'Cause you talk like you got what I need 
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze 
Talk like you bet it all on me 
And you can't take no Ls off me
I know you been
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just tryna somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
How far we go always seems to get better with time, hey
Won't ya, outsmart me, no
Told me that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know ya 
You want me to show ya 
Now we're in the zone, yeah 
And now you're coming over
Over and over again, over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again, over and over again
You tell me I should know ya 
And you want me to show ya, uh 
When were in the zone you 
And now you're coming over
Now you're coming over, you're coming overQuestion is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
YeahYeah, I get it
I get it, yeah
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you 
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah
Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven
Yeah
I knowWrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, "I know you need a break."
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—
2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, "Thanks for givin' to me," like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like “tha Carter”, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard
"Pretty Girls Like Trap Music" so I woke up with my wood hard
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—
I was stealin' from a bitch 
Back when I was 21 
My favorite gun was a SIG 
20 in the clip, head one 
Growin' up, I was a running back
You never made me ran once 
I got shot, sweat started runnin'
That shit was red like Heinz 
I'm kickin', pimpin' like I punt 
But don't you think shit's sweet?
I'm talkin' sweet, deer meat 
I'm talkin' suite like he sleep 
We ain't doin' too much talkin' 
I'm talmbout talkin' like a speech 
Like the President, I kill 'em neat 
I’m talkin' neat like freak
I'm talkin' neat like fleek
I'm talkin' neat like a geek 
You come with beef, I eat a B
I'm talkin' B’s, spellin' bee 
Double R, that's a Rolls
Paint it yellow like it's dairy
I'm talkin' Rose like Derrick
I'm talkin' rolls like a belly 
Like a new car, I got two keys
Tryna score the bucket like a Chevy seat 
Then I heard they been pullin' all week 
I'ma use your name like, "Who is he?"
You get it? Haha!
I said I'ma use a name like, "Who is he?"
Got some gold on, leprechaun, sheesh
Deep sleep short for deceased
Big bezel on the Patty 
I’m talkin' PADI—I meant Patek
Don't try to take it, I got guns
I'm talkin' guns, not pellets 
I watch the game from the floor 
I'm talkin' wood, first mattress
I'm talkin' wood, pants down 
I'm talkin' woods like them clowns 
I got my mink off a monkey
I'm talkin' monkey like Jumanji 
All your diamonds partly sunny
I'm talkin' sunny like D, Sunny 
My diamonds wet, it cost me money
I'm talkin' wet like it's runnin' 
I'm talkin' wet like Katrina 
I'm talkin' wet like Dasani, huh
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—Yeah
Yeah
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to "R.I.P." about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it 
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered 
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it
Yeah, gotta love it
*Laughs*
YeahYeah, I know we just signed a deal but
I need my advance on the next one too
They know I'ma be around
Yeah, I need it
'Cause I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team
I got a really big team
They need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team
Man, what a time to be alive
You and yours vs. me and mine
Are we talkin' teams? Are we talkin' teams?
Oh, you switchin' sides? Wanna come with me?
Look at the smile on me, look at the owl on me
I do not chase girls, but they run a mile for me
Say she gon' ride for me, I'll buy the tires for you
This game is different
You only get one shot when niggas gon' foul on you
Man, fuck 'em all, man, we want it all
Don't get too involved, we gon' knock ya off
And to top it off, I'm with all the dogs
It's a new season and we still breathin'
And I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team
I got a really big team
They need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team
Man, what a time to be alive
I'm drinkin' lean, they thought I died
I run with kidnappers, I'm talkin' 'bout kidnappers
I'm talkin' 'bout murderin' niggas, I'm talkin' 'bout carjackers
You just a battle rapper, I'm an official trapper
Niggas be droppin' subliminals, nigga
That just some jibber jabber
We take a Mellow Yellow then fill it with red forever-ever
These niggas so jelly, jealous
Man, these niggas get scared, they telli'-tellin'
I fuck a check up on everything
I bought some ice when the feds came
I bought that bitch new Celine, I got rings, I got racks like Serena
All of my rings Aquafina, my bitch Aquafina
Pluto and Jupiter, I go to Venus
I'm fresh out the store but I'm not out the cleaners
Who keepin' score 'cause these niggas, they losin'
'Cause I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team
I got a really big team
They need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings
Better be comin' with no strings
We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings
I got a really big team
Man, what a time...Yeah
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight
Uh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot but I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, "Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 
Sometimes I need that romance
Sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper
That's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city That's what they doin', Cam'ron
They actin' like these singers, man
I ain't-I ain't goin' to the studio 'till I got a situation
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer
Who-who gonna be on the hook?

Let her know I read it though, voicemail say she ready though 
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'Cedes Benz pedal
Doin' ninety on the bridge like, "Nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin up the angles, now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four, five chains, man the gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "The first mill' gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it, then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work, ayy
Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
Yeah
I remember I had went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East 'cause them boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out, the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on

Try to tell 'em they ain't got to do it, they insist

Standin' over coffin with a hammer and a nail

I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
 Work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with nigga's souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
 Work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me

I'm with you
Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, I'm with youI wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with this dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
I wake up, and pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control
If I could give everything back to you
All this passion I got, all I ever needed
For me to move on and succeed
For me to move on and succeed
Jealousy, envy and greed
Too much of that shit I don't need it
I turned on the gas with a nickle plated
I sit back and laugh cause these niggas traitors
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
I came out the trenches, I really made it
I came out the gutter, I really made it
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it
Shoot out the car man, no lovey dovey
These bitches, they lookin' for hubbie hubbie
I'm lookin' for paper in any city
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have 'em sticks on us in every city
Take the private cause lately out here we gettin' it
Spent like seven hundred thousand on both of the Bentleys
I got love for the city, I jug and get it
I wake up on a daily basis
I count the money man, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
Wake up and pray every morning
Demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I need acknowledgement, If I got it then tell me I got it then
I'm ballin' outta control, keep on receiving the scholarships
Mayor comin' to the house, nigga please, watch your mouth
I'm the one without a doubt, yeah
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choose by these hoes
Usually they just leave when we done
I don't wanna share no room with these hoes
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change, yeah
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with this dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
I wake up, and pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta controlDiplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, "Where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
InshAllah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira
I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, IMetro Boomin want some more, nigga
Yeah, yeah, get it, get it get it, Southside, yeah
My dope in the bushes
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I did the digital dash
I fucked that bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I sell that dope to your momma, though
Hot on the street like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'm a kid of my word
I hustle the first to the first
These bitches be naggin' the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed up with racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack and I'm muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work, it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a six trey
Chevy, Mercedes, I keep 'em comin'
Fuck all these bitches, I keep 'em comin'
I pull up right now, I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You can't come around here, 'cause it's dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, that's a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and that's confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that car, trick
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got Bape on my back with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she latch on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom? We did it
I see how they counted us out
Bet they never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin', I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I poured up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga, do you really mean it?
When I was sleepin' on the floor, you should see how they treat me
I pour the Actavis, pop pills so I can fight the demons
I did the digital dash
I fucked that bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I sell that dope to your momma, though
Hot on the street like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'm a kid of my word
I hustle the first to the first
These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
If you get hit, you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again, I don't let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again
And again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I'm Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might could fit you in on Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that's making triple what I'm making, what a entrance
That's when you know its a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out, it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin, they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I
I did the digital dash
I fucked that bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I sell that dope to your momma, thoughOne of dem ones—right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, "What are those?"
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right, yeahYeah
Yeah
Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later, how am I the man still?
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side, bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yellin' out, "Pay the guys"
Man, I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to—
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, "Okay, if you say so"
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah
I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to— oh, wait, sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
SZN

Problems hit the gym, they all work out

My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist

They still out to get me cause they never got me
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich 
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit 
All my niggas wanna do is pop style 
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle Yeah, more, yeah
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still, they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, "This what we need to be on," but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge
I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, "What have you done for me lately?"
"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest."
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to 
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to 
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to 
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
Y'all don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
Y'all don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to 
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to 
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to 
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to 
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to 
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to 
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
Yeah, they don't love you like they used to 
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to 
Like I
Take some to getting used to 
Man, they don't love you like they used to, manYeah, yeah
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich

Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me
They still out to get me, they don't get it
I cannot be got, and that's a given
They like, "Pablo—"
"Why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?"
"Why do you know every single bitch that I know?"
"Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?"
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago
South, south side, that's the motto
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, ayy
Throne is back up in it, ayy
In the field like Emmitt, ayy, y'all get so offended, ayy
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'ma let you finish, but I

Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki 
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich 
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit 
All my niggas wanna do is pop style 
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' 
You, you, you, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart
Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heartAnd I know the sun will rise with me 
And I know the sun will rise with me 
And I know the sun will rise with me  
And I know the sun will rise with me
All we wanted was an opportunity
 Lord knows!
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real 
Places they say they've been, we actually going for real 
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping 
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy 
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things 
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real
Huh! You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal
I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink 
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica 
Villa on the water with the wonderful views 
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews 
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss , came to buy the bar 
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car 
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R 
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Everyday them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae 
I run the gang but the ladies think I'm running game 
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate 
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothing short of great Ayy, yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Yeah
Leaving me 
Dippin' out on me 
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly  learned yourself through me 
Already gave you what you needed, I guess 
I guess  yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody 
Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody 
Did it over text, didn't call me 
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody
Even if you gotta leave somebody  yeah
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded 
Most of these things I don't wanna say 
I wanna be around while you chasin' 
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth but it's dangerous 
You got somethin' real, not basic 
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded 
Most of these things, I don't wanna say 
I wanna be around while you chasin'
You wanna hit me up when you make it 
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth but it's dangerous 
You got somethin' real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop 
Yeah, dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing 
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in 
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded 
Most of these things I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' 
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stop AXL , AXL , AXL 
Woi-oi
Ayy
I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train
Ayy
Yeah
AXL , AXL , AXL Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, doneYeah
All you self-promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since "No Scrubs" and "No Pigeons"
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs
They hit my phone like, "You did that"
They even hit my line like, "Where you been at?"
It's always on some shit like
"When can I get a favor?" or, "Where my bitch at?"
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?"
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this
Yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind
Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this, uh
I'ma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha, ha
Bad breed, bad bwoy
Uh-huh, yeah
That's right, yeahYeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave
Couple figures, killers call and collect 
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next 
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat 
Roll with us if you really wanna get it 
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter 
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper 
I got the hookup and there's really no limit 
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA 
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce 
Gotta count on my allowance 
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it 
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out 
And I'll never talk about it 
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest 
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house 
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it 
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave itNever thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
But, I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But, I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga
Out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been droppin' out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations durin' regular seasons
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ahh nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer to My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement
Guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna
See you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put their arm around you
Now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they care to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton
This ain't that local action
The haters just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things
You niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to
Ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit
When I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was poppin' off with "Ain't I"
Way before niggas had they hands out
Like they doin' macarena
But, who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they knowI said, "Tell me what's really goin' on"
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said "If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em"
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoaI like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you—
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are
And I know all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
And I know all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  I'm so
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you areOh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long
But don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too longI don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. 
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
This is the 6’s year
Six hundreds instead of six, OVO
You know we’ll be rockin' our asses out
To my big brother Drizzy
You know what I’m sayin'?
More Life, 6 to the world, gang shitRider shit
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who"
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who," yeah
And she like, "Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my lifeBreathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure 
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again 
Soon as you get in
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with youDoin' well dog
Yeah, me and all my
Yeah, me—yeah
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where yo bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog
Oh and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still—
Wow, all praise to the most high up...If you was in a pine box 
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in an-and fall asleep 
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me 
If you was in a pine box 
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep 
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me
'Cause you are, the-the death of me, you-you, the death of me
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar, women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all
'Cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as… myself
And it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you're outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I diedUh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from overTwo-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?

Now and forever, I'll bring it homeYeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street, got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib, goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast 
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no 
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine
We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine

Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Used to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man
You keep talking that, "You was this and you had this"
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, "you're such a dog", I said, "you're such a bone."
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, "show me some"
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no 
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine

I'm on the best side, got the TEC lined
In the whip, on the left side, on a death ride 
MAC-10 and the spesh flies, and the TEC slide
Nutty shit like somethin' just climbed out the X-Files 
Textbook, like it's old school, like in textiles
Lighty lookin' healthy and she gets smiles

You dun know, it's Hollowman Giggs
Right now, just here with the big man Drizzy, you get me?
More Life flex, you dun know
OVO and SN1 to the world, brapHa, yeah
They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?"
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go"
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, "Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?"
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians – them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth hereHonestly
Honestly, I'm tryin' to stay focused
You must think I've got to be joking when I say
I don't think I can wait
I just need it now, better swing my way
I just need some dick, I just need some love
Tired of fucking with these lame niggas, baby
I just need a thug
Won't you be my plug? Ayy
You could be the one, ayy
We could start with a handshake, baby
I'ma need more than a hug
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now, oh now
Give it to me like you need it, baby
Want you to hear me screaming, heavy breathing
I don't need a reason, baby
I want it 'til you can't fight
I can give it to you right, babe, oh
I wanna be your healing
I can be real good
Please don't get in your feelings
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, and you can't judge 
You don't really call on me like you should
Link up, I'll roll through the hood
Problems, but everything's all good, my love
Your nigga doesn't want smoke with me, nah, no way
Trust me, it's all okay, trust me, it's all
You just need some, someone that's calm and patient
Submission, domination
Arched back, deep stroke
White wine, weed smoke
That's my best combination
You just need some dick with no complications
You just need some, you just need some
Late night attention, uncondition
All that you're missing, my babe
Fucked up, shouldn't even have to justify
I get it, I'm on your side, guys get their way all the time
Besides, pleasure not meant for one side
You should just do what's best for your mind
How 'bout I just take my time?
You call up my line, I fall up inside you
Girls need love, too, I know
Girls need love, too 
Girls, girls need love, too 
Girls need love 
Girls need love 
Girls need love, too
Girls need love, too
Girls need love, too
Girls need love, tooI hate when, I hate when people say they feel me man
I hate that shit
It’ll be a long time before y'all feel me, if ever
For real
You won’t feel me 'till everybody
Say they love you, but it’s not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass keep getting thicker than a plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It’s feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, nigga
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride
You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride
I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I’m driving right up to it now
Make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping M’s and sipping dirty jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I’m bout to fuck and I’m just praying that it feels good
I really don’t know much but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my nigga don’t believe it
I mean, sure, there’s some bills and taxes I’m still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches
Still scorching as if I didn’t notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
I’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldn’t fuck with my freshman floater 
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it
My juniors and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The rideUh, I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: "Nobody's workin' as hard as you"
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights'll make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
Mm, I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — this'll do
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it goToo rich for who? Y'all just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
I've never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight, we like to, we like to, we like to—
Yeah, if shit was at a eight, we like to make it ten
1da sent this in, I'm goin' up all the way
I don't like to talk when there's nothin' else left to say 
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin' play, your trainer is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— 
I gotta breathe real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole 'nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only blessed when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin' to 
And the product is still the best though
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate man, I had to Copperfield like presto
Voilà, tada 
Never a matter of "could I?" or "should I?"
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—
Miss makin' 'em pay
Helipad from Will Smith crib straight to the stage
Three Forum shows but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is smokey, y'all stay safe in this place 
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your niggas is pressin' play, your nanny is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— 
Had to go and hit reset, now we here
I been on top for three sets of three years
I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with
I can't fly if I could sit on the wing of that shit 
I try to pay it less mind
They been keepin' tabs on me like I'm payin' next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys 
Yeah, never a matter of "could I?" or "should I?"
Kiss my mom on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—
Hahaha, I can't argue with you, no! You mad!
Look at you, you mad! You big mad! Haheheh
I'm happy! Leave me alone!
I just want some money, a lot of money
I don't get paid to argue with you
No! Who is you? You ain't nobody!
You madYeah, know how nights like this go
OVOFBG
60 naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitress
When you gettin' a lot of money you can't help but save it
But tonight, me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend
This adderall got me to the ceiling 
I think them percocets had me in my feelings 
I peel them hundreds on hundreds

Then throw out them dollars, them bitches gonna holla

We don't take it in, we just change locations
We don't take it in, we just change locationsYeah, woo
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

Rule number one, to be a boss-ass bitch 
Never let a clown nigga try to play you 
If he play you, then rule number two 
Is fuck his best friends and make 'em yes men 
And– 
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try and get you off my mind
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta

On my plate, lookin' up
Outer space, Pearly Gates
I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change upAyy, elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
If you need me, you can call me, I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy  workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy 
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne  when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' 
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me, I begin to write the thesis
Franny got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marineland, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer, I'ma be tweakin'Hendrix, yeah
I woke up like this
Reporting live from the fucking gutter, bitch
I ain't talking about some big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money, bitch
Reporting live from the gutter
I'll buy these motherfuckers talking big money shit, bitch
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talking 10 mill just to get an asset
I know them tears still falling down on my last bitch
This money made me hungry, I'm a savage
I've seen the stars lining up you couldn't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic, count it up and started laughing, ah
I went back inside the attic, count it up and started laughing, ah
Cuban links hanging on my wrist, I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look up, I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see heron everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean, I ain't started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean, my nigga still there
Just imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that's gon' keep it real now
Got a lot of pretty bitches, I just paid their bills now
Money make her feel good but damn she make me feel good
Known for getting that guala out in Europe but I'm still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a model, fuck her like I'm on my last damn dollar
Reporting live from the fucking gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' about some big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money, bitch
Reporting live from the gutter, I will buy this motherfucker
It's not even a discussion, woo
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gonna end up dipping with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her tripping off of yay, yay
Pillow talking, dishing out on all y'all
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take what’s coming
Live from the gutter dog, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dog, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dogs that go Karrueche with the chopsticks
And we gon' miss you
They don’t want no smoke, they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through
And I'm

Swear to god, I will buy this motherfucker, ahDJ Paul
TWhy
Ayy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah, ayy
Ten of us, we movin' as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums 
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old
I promise I'm bridgin' the gap
Woo! You know what I'm sayin'?
Woo! Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These niggas around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, get close enough to HOV, smell like a kilo still 
First album 26, I ain't need no deal 
Already a hood legend, I ain't need no Shyne 
First Rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah
Stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments
Dope boys, Off-White, lookin' like soft white on 'em
Heh, you know what I'm sayin'?
We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
Live every word that I'm rappin'
Say I lost 90 bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe
Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been
I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like Young
I got your President tweetin', I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed X and let Zimmerman live, shhh, s-streets is done
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'

You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?I been waitin' on this
Yeah
All of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces, but there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a—
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my 'Malis pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to— Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
RIP my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself]
The only thing I'm seein' I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins. We gonna have so many fuckin' fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof. Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days
Soulja Boy, Drake
Oh, we made it
Turn me up just a little bit in the headphones
Worldwide, international
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it, ayy
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it
Yeah, she said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007, I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!" 
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin' 
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
I'ma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show
Ayy, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it, ayy
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it
Yeah, if they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it
If I said it, I meant it, there's no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up, watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it 
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience 
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in yo' face and say "Nigga we made it!"
I swear that we made it, selloff that ting, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell ya, I don't need no favors 
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it!"
Ayy, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it
I remember standing in the hood
Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good
Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!
Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, two times I crashed
Ha, nigga we made it!
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it
I look a nigga in his face and say "Nigga we made it!"
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters
And these days I don't need no favors, ayy
Nigga we made it!
You already know man
Phone call back to the old hood, see what's goin' on
Brrt brrt, nigga we made itUh, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy but I'm still the man, come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands, then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17
Want a lot, can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn
Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, "Are we straight?"
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face, watch with the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Ayy
UberX to Hidden Hills
Give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills
Then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road
You could hit it with a stone
I be out here on my own
I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town
'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Yeah, yeah
Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm– I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a jokeHere we go, yeah
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like "Billie Jean", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time
And all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at
Or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud
To let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this my G
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
Here we go againHello
I've been hurt so many times
It got to a point
When I decided
I can't do this anymore
I need someone to hold me
I need someone that needs me
I need someone that loves me
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to
You need me to
You know, we don't have to be dramatic
Just romantic
Do all the little things, little things, little things
That excites me
As your woman
Give me a kiss goodnight
Over the phone
When you're working late
When you're out of town
Tell me how much you need this
'Cause we deserve it
We can be together, but
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to 
You need me to 
You need me to
Hold one vibes

Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, baby?
'Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
Can I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?
You do so much more than that for me
Can I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?
'Cause that's the side you never get to see
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time

Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Before I turn the lights outYeah, turn everything up
Yeah, oh yeah
Turn everything up a little more
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright
Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all the–
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time 
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind
You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things would get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mindDraped in all designer, draped in all designer
Draped in all designer, draped in all designer
I got all exotic bitches you gon' think I'm racist
I just called a gang of bitches out of immigration
You gon' think we printing money cause the way we make it
I got all these fucking whips and ain't got no payments
Pink slips sitting in the dashboard with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas  looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
I dropped a few whoopty whoops in my cup
Put it on my tab, put her on my tab
Franchise tag on me, Bron Bron
Steph Curry wrists, nigga, Oakland
Percies for the bitches Bishop, magic Don Juan
Standing ovation and an encore
And I keep the check, Nike concord
Pink slips sitting in the dashboard with me
Got a gang of broads riding with me, on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas  looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Whole time I was ready
They was like, "Hold up, wait a minute"
I was like, "Nah, nigga, let's get it"
This that OVO Halloween gang, you know how I'm rocking already
If you come here trying to take some, there's a lot more where that came from
And it really ain't no thing, I got Summer P in this thing
I just drop the jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings
Yeah, yeah, up and away
Y'all should have seen this shit coming in May
We doing 300 records a day
Who really think they can get in the way?
Nah, nah, niggas is bitter, they hurting
Look at the business mergers
Throwed back when I'm swerving
Big body my Suburban
Everything I do on purpose
I'm blowing up like it's urgent
And she was acting like a virgin
I gave it to her then I curved her
Pink slips sitting in the dashboard with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas for looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug

Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plugYeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh 
Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of C-notes, get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese, you don't want drama, capisc'?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me, it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah

I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me

Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates, I send the Maybach out in neighborhoods
They never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I'm in this ho
But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled "Surprise!", I wasn't surprised
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga

YMCMB
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
When I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga

I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see
You liking someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusin' me
Don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl

Oh, you fancy, huh?
Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh

From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, figure they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like “Voilà!” You do it right he just might buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, triple-white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe

Go, go, go, go, go 
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it

Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on the road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah
When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em

So watch how you speak on my name, you know?Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Ayy, yeah
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
Yeah, ayy, look
I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover
Poured up some Hi-Tech and wait 'til it bubble
Young Gunna Gunna, I make this shit double
Hit Eliantte and left with a puddle
It's me, Drake, and Baby, you know you in trouble
Run up my check, my bitch sprinted the shuttle
Sign plus an M, bought a Benz for my brother
Painted all black, the interior butter
I drip like a leak and that's word to my mother
Yeah, came out the street, gotta sleep with a cutter
Family a beast, we gon' eat us a supper
My dick in her mouth like she teethin' or somethin'
Sound like it could be Drip Season this summer
Ain't no comparin' 'cause we number one
In black and white Chanel, I look like a nun
The police in shock, don't know who got a gun
Don't got what I got 'cause I shop in Milan
It's winter, I still took the top off the don
The kid was surprised that my trunk in the front
I know you a upset they don't shine in the sun
Cuban link look like a box of crayons
I'm still at the lot, tryna cop the Cayenne
I told the judge, "Fuck it", I'm goin' on the run
You want it, my dawgs'll look out for the bond
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride
Bread winner like I'm Kevin Gates
And I swear to God, I don't get tired
From the trenches, now I'm goin'
Spend a whole hundred on a new wristwatch
Don't gotta drip, I can leave it to Gunna
Runnin' this shit, only been out two summers
That 4x4 truck, I post 300
Boy, at whoever, they know how I'm comin'
Ain't got no feelings, I'm here for the money
Treat every club like a Magic on Monday
Niggas ain't rich for real, they gettin' fronted
Gave her a dime, told her fix up her stomach
By the time she get back, I'ma switch up my number
Cap to her friend like I been on her bumper
Lately, I been the topic of discussion
Draco was foreign, they shipped it from Russia
Bad vibes at my show like I'm Usher
If she tell me "No" once, I won't even touch it
All I do is get her out here, abortion
Act like I've been rich, I used to have nothin'
Drizzy hit me up like he got another one
Money ain't even came in from the other one
Fuck it, I'm hot, so I might as well double up
Seem like everything I get on a number one
They tryna team up to beat me, they huddlin' up
Ever catch me out in traffic, I'm cuttin' up
Every city we go to, it be lit as fuck
Tryna put the police on us, get rid of us
And I'm gettin' by, let 'em choose sides
We get M's in by the shoe size
I don't fuck with y'all type of kind
I done seen all y’all dickride

Your new shit sound like you do covers
Of all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning
On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga
But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is
That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through errythang...
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD…
Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga
Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back 
Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be?
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ********
Hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
'Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less than me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's backYeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
"Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"
I said, "I respect it, no problem"
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you met after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
Than when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn, coach, put him in"
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah
For real
Facts, you know what I'm sayin'?
Hahaha, yeahBeen a minute since we've slept together
Finna get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely
Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely
Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s yacht, that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae
But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely
This shit ain’t my faultPart I
Yeah
Pool in my eyes
As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend
We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already

Wonder how you've been
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?

I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
God knows it
Pure mind and pure soul I possess, He knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
People change, I'm not surprised
Devil's working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have tried
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
You put food on the table for me, aye?
Alright, fam, soft. I see you, aye?
You pay my bills, right?
It's light
You're a wasteman
Top story
Wah?Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—OhD. Hill 
Ayy
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees every day, had to talk with Messiah
I'm in that 8 and that 1 and that 2, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city, you actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I should've moved you away from Houston before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the second string
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you 
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires
Ayy
Self-control has never been your thing
Don't think it'll help if there's a ring with a rock in it
Where I'm from, they serve the soda clean 
You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan, but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you 
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
'Cause you got desires
Ooh, shawty, you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lotta secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? 
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, should've stayed solid
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Déjà vu, you wanted things and you got 'em
Déjà vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Déjà vu, déjà
Déjà
Alright, so unfortunately, I'm still here 
But, you know, if you're here, it's still up
In the building
And you just wanna hear some chune, some music
I think, you know, you found the right spot
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
You know, shout out my brother Drake, for you know
Popping this off real quickYeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like, fo real
This life shit is everywhere, you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take you down through there
Make me wanna take you down through there
I'll take it there
Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things
That don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man
Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
'Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6
And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, manWatch out for me, I'm bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certifi-i-ied
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I
They gon' bang this here all summerti-i-ime
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Yeah, yeah
Turn me way up, my voice is really low
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
 Watch out
Why, nigga?  Cops out
 Top down
I started out way down low
Started from the bottom, now we here now
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love y'all too!
We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life
You need devotion
Can I hear right on?
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We live for it
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all
I said it's alright
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'allKush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying "you should quit", cars saying "fuck your life"
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches 
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww
Drizzy say get her, I'ma get her
I got the kind of money, make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch, you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
 Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like "yes" and you like "no"
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww
I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch 
Aww, aww, aww
Aww yeah we in this bitch
Aww, aww, aww
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, awwLook at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeahOnly holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is "Where the rest of my commas?"
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, "How Does It Feel?"
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me 
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing 
Tempt me, drive me 
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly 
It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for youYeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Jheeze, yeah
Right, look, look
Tell me how you really feel
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But y'all don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard you never claimed the hood
Heard the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big
That they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah
Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lotta sides on the same side
OVO, we a gold mine
But I'm goin' gold, no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city goin' crazy
Whole city goin' crazy
Top five, no debatin'
Top five, top five, top five
And the whole city rate me
And I'm back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit
We done really put some days in
Hey, why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?
What happened?
Did you win the Grammy? God damn
You actin' like you fuckin' won a trophy and shit
This nigga turnt the fuck up
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me

I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax
Get pissed off, start airin' it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I don't want features from nan them
I don't want features or nothin'
You can't even get on my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter
We sittin' right on the courtside
I know the players on both side
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys
Black tints, low profile
Celebratin' everyday
'Cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house
Countin' up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a GrammyWould've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know, oh-oh-oh
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women "bitches," but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back, I
Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came backHey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you...
Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures
Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
Ki-Killa, Killa
Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in the Louboutins
What you want, what you need
I can be your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it
And together we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice  they'd notice 
That we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
Every time we come around, round, round
And they'd notice  they'd notice
You shut it down
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—
You shut that thing down, you shut it down 
You shut it down, you shut it down 
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
You shut it, ohh
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You looking good girl, go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl, go, go, go, go go go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not trying to say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me
Lay you down, down, down
I’m trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut itThe money , cars 
The clothes , the hoes
I suppose
Yeah
I want the money , money and the cars
Cars and the clothes , the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Drizzy
Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it
I want the money , money and the cars
Cars and the clothes , the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2"
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:
I want the money , money and the cars
Cars and the clothes , the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Alright well, um, alright. We... we'll fuckin' figure it out. You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it, you know, makin' it to the top. All the way to the top. Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'?
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me "Shoppin' Bag Drizzy"
Or call me Mr. "Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?"
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...
Yeah, I want the money , money and the cars
Cars and the clothes , the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be , I just wanna be successful 
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Yeah, it's like I, it's like I know what I gotta say
I just don't know... how to say it... to you
Uh, pardon the swag, but bitch, it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearin' bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, ain't that a female dog?
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell, "God"
Weezy Baby, I go re-al hard
No further details, boyTreat you like princess
Rest in heaven, Diana
Piquing my interest
She got peak like Montana
England breeds proper girls
Where are all your good manners?
Reply with pleasantries
Honestly, I can't stand ya
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
What you thought of me?
Never had me missin' a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap; nowadays, it's free
People are only as tough as their phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me
Bitch been with this boy, yeah, for four weeks
I told her go on a date
All of a sudden, she married
Didn’t say get bloodclaat married
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
— What I'm sayin', in today really at our big, big age if you're gettin' with someone right now and you're linking them for couple weeks, they should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see' so lemme lock off the ting but obviously in the world that we live in today is not like that
— He is… did that — but obviously it takes time— You're chattin' shit. First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning, it should be like honeymoon–
— That's what I said, that's what I said! The beginning is always honeymoon season
— Yeah, well you overdo it and he's overdoin' it. Both of you are overdoin' it right now
— Yeah, well, alrightYesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I-I- I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go
Should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!"
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"
Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit "redial", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's overAll the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
What are we even doing?
Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
'Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him"
And I say "Well, goddamn"
Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
All of this, it's alcohol, it's drugs, weed, it's everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot.  
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted…
They know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the heat of the moment. It's the heat of the moment and that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment.  
I agree
This shit, that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment. Be a 100% woman, or try and be a 100% man, and use a fucking condom
HaaaHaha, haha
Yeah, ayy 
In the whip solo
No one's gotta know 
Knockin' at your door
I don't gotta work anymore 
You can
Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands 
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'
Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way 
In the whip solo, no one's gotta know
 after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
 after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
 after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night 
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes
In the whip solo, no one's gotta know
 after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
 after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
 after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it
And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on
I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow
But I do it to her
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end
Ayy, yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know
I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like, like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm goneYeah, I never really
Talk about dick that I wanna give you or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, hair grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like, like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin' 
Soothin', keep it right there, no movin'
Make my way around the bases-es
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school 
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now
Did somebody…
Who'd they say that baby look like?
Drake!
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it 
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it 
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it, yeahYou ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me
Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah
Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that wayOoh, baby, yeah
Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but knowThese are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, "I guess it does" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah
Uh, yeah, this what yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money

Fuck with my young niggas, XO Gang
Get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches
Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows and Screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Now, let me gon' hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything to make shit go slow
Yeah, money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in us, oh, no
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
It's simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker-free, no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My momma still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker, drums playing
Tap-dance to my drum roll 
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up in some old shit to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make do with what's left
Yeah, I do this shit to the death, yeah, I do this shit til I'm gone
Yeah, I told you it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong, ooh
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let these niggas know it's real

You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
That's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up
Soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full
But you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game
In which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me nowIt's your fuckin' birthday 
It's a fuckin' celebration 
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh
It's your birthday, baby, it's your birthday
Yeah, who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough
I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, Reese's, don't be ridiculous
Just say your piece and peace up like Ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than Anitta
Bakin', baby, tell me where I need to–
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday
It's your brrrrrrr–
It's your fuckin' birthday 
It's a fuckin' celebration 
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control 
It's a celebration, oh oh
They tried it, they went for it
All year and you're still here, just ignore it
If it ain't the real thing, you don't want it
GG, CC's all on ya
It's your month and you know it 
And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you
You say, "Play this shit," they better play it 
For you , on time
And I miss the days that you was all mine
Haven't been official in a long time
So tell me where I need to–
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday
It's your brrrrrrr–
It's your fuckin' birthday 
It's a fuckin' celebration 
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh
Oh, it's your fuckin' birthday, oh, ohThis is why I do this shit
I think they call this "venting"
Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of meWhy do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly"
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em"
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, "'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill"
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real
Yeah, that's all I can sayI'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody actin' like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke, "I'm out in Miami, too"
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fuckin' with her, I don't really need her, aw
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
One time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted, door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet, skeet, skeet, water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt, Tunechi!
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
T-Raww, skinny nigga, big balls
Fuck around and get dragged: RuPaul
You funny little nigga, Duval
Out of this world, Total Recall
Call a bitch, ride dick like a seesaw
Sorta like a donkey, act a ass nigga hee-haw
Ridin round in the ‘rarri wit the top off
While you in the window, man I’m probably on my next car
Aight, mighty duck with the ice on
Real LA nigga, chucks with the gun drawn
Drawing on your face you’re a clown jack in the box
Boy that’s your bop, she my new pum pum star
Stars in the back, them my homies, they don’t act
Acting brand new, fuck her never call her back
Matt Forte got the bitch running back
Damn, That’s the motto you don’t know it’s like that
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness 
Block that account, it's a catfish 
Block that account, it's a catfish 
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness 
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish
You don't know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni 
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud nine, a man's extra cozy  
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, man's so unruly 
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy 
Front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade 
Red umbrella when I make it rain 
My whole team winnin', we don't play your game
Sound like me, but they ain't the same 
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans 
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness 
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish 
Check my account, that's a madness 
Check my account, that's a madness 
Block that account, it's a catfish 
Block that account, it's a catfish
Yeah, they're nothin' like me, I'm a fuckin' villain
Go against me, that's a tough decision 
Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision 
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
 So don't forget to remember me 
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see 
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me? 
 Taliban, Halloween 
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline  
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine 
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now it's my world, you can have the scene
It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfishThings have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervousI'm more than just an option 
Refuse to be forgotten 
I took a chance with my heart 
And I feel it taking over
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I'm more than just a number 
I doubt you'll find another 
So every single summer 
I'll be the one that you'll remember and—
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
It's more than just a mission 
You hear, but you don't listen 
You better pay attention 
And get what you've been missing
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apartYeah
Uh-huh
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, "Drake is just a younger you"
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you, bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout?
Young Mula, baby
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay

I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's onLet me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever, I haven’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I’m single, thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say "for life", y'all say "forever"
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’ma need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talkin' his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her name's the game
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang, I'm doing my thang
Got my top dropped on this beautiful night
It's a beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got 'em lil brah, unforgettable
You’ll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable
Let me know, let me knowYea, it's Drizzy baby
You already know who it is
It's the first time I'm high
It's the first time I smoked in like 3 months
I'm sorry mama, I had to do it to them
40 I see you
O, I see you homie
I stay late tonight right?
You know what happen when I stay late
Yea, Boi-1da!
I swear it's like this every single time
Toronto I got you
I got us
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, well I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to, the artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth full of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it "playing checkers"
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money I'll be happy to connect ya
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the President
Someone cut the lights on! Where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you trying to zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers are liars and their women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
And he got it for me and I'm as happy can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off a rebound
Yea, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because the nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they trying to get their swagger right
Cause I dunn came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go and get a Blue's Clue?
Oops! I mean a red clue; Wayne's here, Soo-woo!
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake I hate to see him so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on the Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burnin' like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And no the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth then pull the zipper down and see
No homo though
Yea, um, I'm going in
Drizzy I got us, this is my promise
Ima bring that barrel to them bitches' eyeliners
And what I make up, would fuck up your skin
I pick the buck up and buck-buck then buck-buck again
I would butt-fuck your friend
Then suck up her twin, I put the buck-up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin, now don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude, always had a black tool
Even when I was at school, cause bullies aren't bullet-proof
Red scarf, hoody too, probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything good as you, no I do everything better
I get paid for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone. Like a dog motherfucker I am going for your neck
In a sec, intercept, bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yup I am headed to the buck like
Buck-buck again! Might fly to L.A and just fuck Karrine
Nahh fuck Karrine! Lets get bucks again, and fuckin' spend
Them bucks, and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told you I'mma do it, I did it
Got my city on my fitted, bout to pop it, let's get it
Lets get it motherfucker whatcha waitin on
It is bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted
I'm with it if money is the it you want me with
And I probly just spit on the chick you won't be with
And I hate a boney bitch only like em only thick
And I own hip-hop, if you don't spit I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like Drake Drizzy Rogers
Or Drizzy Drake Rogers I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game I'm too willing to play harder
So harder I go, there he go
They chant MVP when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jas what it do
The haters on their face and in their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you, radder than you, et cetera
I told ya, I get paid by the letter like
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y
ZZ Top, yes he rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a foot note, how long can he could go
Wondering when he stop, bitch when the beat stop
So I'mma keep rockin' to the sheet rock bend
Then the heat I send burn skin, the end
Young mula, baby, uhhHow did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time 
Show me a good time 
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time 
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time 
Show me a good time 
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time 
Yeah, uhh
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time 
Show me a good time 
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time Hey, Instagram
This song I've been writing, oh, for a few months
I don't know, I, I started writing it about family
Just came up now, so
Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck
Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
You got some liquor at the house?
Yeah
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
I don't see it
Okay, hahaha
Ayy
Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
Yes, sir
Hold on, hold on
Woo
Lord, I already passed on all that 
You go 'head on, hahaYeah, yeah
Yeah

Oh, my right wrist a Ferrari 
Foreign breed, American, she call me papi 
Vroom, vroom, Hellcat, give it to the goons 
On that Earl Manigault, shootin' it out the spoon
Seen a prom queen smoke crack when I was lil'
Million dollars in cash like I sell drugs 
Gave my bitch a hundred racks, vacuum sealed up 
Vacuum sealed up
FBG, YSL, know just what's brackin', yeah 
Told my story, gotta clear it by your daddy, yeah 
FBG, OVO, what's hannenin'?

D4L, Stunna Man, man, what's hannenin'? 
Bowen Homes, you know, that shiesty shit 
You go outside, you better back it 
Go to Palm Springs for a daytrip
Freeband, October's Own, it's the same shit
Shawty keep on knockin' back the shots, better pace this
Woah, woah, banknotes, presidential faces
Woah, woah, Bankhead, started seein' spaceships, woah
We just started fuckin', she impatient
Now she want a butt lift, now she want some LASIK
Just to see the bag clearer, that way she can chase it
Ayy, ayy
I remember grade six, I was up in Payless tryna get some Asics
Now I'm Nike'd down in a motherfuckin' snake pit
Now I'm type of nigga give it out and I don't take shit 
I been in the cut for thirteen thousand months
All that brr, you gon' think we from Saudi Arabia
Money counter brr , ayy
My trap comin' up the street, brr 
I ran a check up on my feet, brr 
Bentley talk, Bentley talk, brr 
Go ask your mama, I'm a boss, brr 
I got oil, I'm your daddy, brr 
I bought her a 'Rari , brr 
I eat calamari 
I'ma let her park me
FBG, YSL, know just what's brackin', yeah 
Told my story, gotta clear it by your daddy, yeah 
FBG, YSL, what's hannenin'? 
Richard Mille, all this year, nigga, what's hannenin'? 
Louis Vuitton bandana, bro, what hannenin'? 
D4L, Stunna Man, say what's hannenin'? 
Bowen Homes, you know, that shiesty shit 
You go outside, you better back itHands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinkin' of
But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
'Cause you don't know who I was before you
And basically, to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I, mmm
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit in love with me
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you, oh
Oh, ohEven though you're all alone
All alone when I am gone
I just wanna keep you warm
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yeah, yes, I'll be there
'Cause when I'm all alone, I think about your face
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away 
All I wanna do is give all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet
Promise that I won't forget
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, oh, yes, I'll be there, oh
About to board a flight, sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you but I'm so far away 
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me, flyLike what?
 Yeah, yeah
Six, six, six, six, six, six

She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas , Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas , Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas , Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas , Houstatlantavegas
And she dance to the song

We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin', all-star weekend
One hotel room that all y'all sleep in
Housekeeper knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin' right all season
But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy
Throw your ones up in the air

Throw your ones up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Oh, oh, ohWaited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We should've did this already
Said I got a email today
Kind of thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I get lonely too
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
I get lonely
I get lonely
Just like youUh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause
You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me "Heartbreak Drake", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah
Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like
ManYeah, I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Still with the dawgs that I grew beside
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
I'm outside in an AMG, yeah
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
I just caught a shawty off a finsta
Just threw on a hoodie, it's a Crenshaw
Way that I been livin' unconventional
I'm just tryna make it to the end, ya know
Certain things just started gettin' tenser
Think we need to have us an adventure
I could be your man but maybe down the road
Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome
Rather see my heart turn crystal
I can't even front like I don't miss ya
Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own
Soon as I free up, I'm 'bout to pop up on your phone like
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Yeah
Heart's still on javelin, baby
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
I was pullin' off 'fore they knew me
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me
When it was you and me
I felt like I love you too much to change you
You believe in angles more than angels
Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you
Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you
Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you
Wish it stayed the same for you, sorry
I'm sorry
And-and-and-and—
I'm outside in a—
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm— 
I'm outside in a—

Uh-huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
On these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenants
And if I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfuckin' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' wit it
She said "I seen it all", I say "No you fuckin' didn't"
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "Bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hardYou must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, where Jen and Melissa
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
It's some views from the 6
Just some views from the 6Yeah, look
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
Stay in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck 'bout jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's thatAyy, yeah
Ayy, ayy 
Writin' this from Florida with love 
When I linked with Mexiko, I knew I found a plug 
Rest in peace to Static, yellin' "Shawty want a thug," ayy
Bottles in the club, ayy, know I love to touch 
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
Went and got a chain for me, I had to give it up 
Niggas had they pistols loaded pointed at my truck, ayy
And you know that lesson stuck 
From that day I never touched the road without a 
Ayy, from that day I never saw the point in talkin' tough 
Hasn't happened since, I guess you niggas know what's up 
Yeah, haven't seen the 6ix in like a month 
Fuck that, I'm back, baby, where the love? 
Rappers that I threw an alley-oop are throwin' subs 
But they gotta dap me when they see me, that's what's up 
I let that shit slide, I got everything
I could lose it all if I'm reactin' to the petty things
Know that if I see you, I'ma ask you if you said them things
YMB the gang and they down to stain anything, mhm
Yeah, that's right
YMB the gang and they down to stain anything, mhm
Yeah, that's right
YMB the gang and you know them niggas…
Booted up, turned up, piped up 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love?
Booted up, turned up, piped up 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
Writin' this from Florida with love 
When I linked with Mexiko, I knew I found a plug 
Rest in peace to Static, yellin' "Shawty want a thug," ayy
Bottles in the club, ayy, know she wanna fuck 
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
We ain't even get to reminiscin' what it was 
Moral of the story is the story finished us
Damn, and you know that lesson stuck 
Haven't left the 6ix in like a month 
Fuck that, I'm here, baby, where the love? 
Fuck that, I'm here, baby, just because 
I would never leave, but I could, though 
Yes, I know I leave you, not for good, though 
Same way you could diss, but you wouldn't, though
'Cause you know good and well that I'm...
Booted up, turned up, piped up 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love?
Booted up, turned up, piped up 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love? I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can’t believe we’re finished
My life is movin’ fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can’t put this behind me
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could’ve had my all by now, by now
It’s been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I swear I heard you call
But when I heard you'd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
I'm steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keep looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
That's why I'm asking this question...
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I can't go to bed
I'm thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a U-Haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We were on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of youUh
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time, whoa
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever, and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
The girl or the world? You see, someone gotta lose
I thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?
Night's fallin', lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one elseYeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go
And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, "Fuck the world with a long dick!"
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her?
Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read?
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried
Woo, Young Mula, baby
YeahThis here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new , brand new , brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new , brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl 
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new , brand new , brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new , brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl 
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
Late, late, late, late
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new , brand new , brand new
Show me if this is brand new 
New, new, new , oh, yeah, yeah, yeahYeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like 
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it 
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say "My baby's famous and I knew it" 
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF 
Miss Andreena Mill
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X 
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And "Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest"
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
 lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah manFirst time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply
Trust
Trust who?
Watchin' my back even when I'm in the booth
Oh, trust who?
Doin' my thing, but I'm down to come clean, not like you
I wanna make you feel the weight's off your shoulders too
I'll take it
Just tell me it can't be that crazy
And even if it is that crazy, baby
I'll take it
I want you, I know you're not an angel
Not you
Oh, just save it
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm wavy and I'm sayin' things
That I don't mean, but I do mean
And I don't want you to miss me
'Cause there's no way that you're sorry
And you're crying and you're sayin' things
That I do believe, but I don't even
Want you to get in my mind
I'm supposed to be in your mind 
For the first time in a long time
For the first time in a long
For the first time in the longest time
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply
Yeah 
Ayy
Hurtin' deeply inside
Trust
Trust
Trust
Trust who?
Trust me and I can set you free
Left your man, came straight to me
You the real MVP, my love
Ride dirty like Pimp C
You a real ten-speed freak, shawty
You was everything a nigga need
You was everything to me, my love
Why you keep that little shit from me?
Left me down on bended knee
When I scooped you in the Maybach
The only time a nigga ever made you take a backseat
Why you do that little shit to me, shawty?
When you know that we was meant to be
Why'd you keep those things from me, my love? 
I've given you enough time
Hurtin' deeply inside
Trust
Trust
Hurtin' deeply, deeply
Thought I knew the real, then they flipped
How many times did I ask about this, on God?
Why you let me find out like this, on God?
Houston, we got a problem, my dawg
All my niggas love you, got us all involved
Ain't no goin' back to how we started off
No, no, no, noYou finally start to care
I show up so unprepared
You're ready for something new
I'm still where I was last year
Meanwhile we're talking it out
You keep leaving things at my house
Seems like you're wanting to stay
But you need to know..
I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a man, I'm just a guy
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
Now got a life, back where I stay
Still pay a car note for this girl, around my way
You got the game and the talk
Keep turnin' out how I thought
Kept my feelings on low, all alone
Intuition never ever wrong
So what the hell, mix some vodka with Italian
Carousel, hitting circles I'm a stallion
And I'm a real one nigga, I'm my own med
You looking so damn thirsty, let me throw it back
Baby we are on to something, maybe if we had the time
Used to give my love for nothing, trust me, I'll be alright
I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a girl, I'm on my grind
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
I got a life, back where I stay
Alicia’s still my only girl around my way
I said baby, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
Baby I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on a wave, wave
I said baby, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
Baby I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on a wave, waveI'm tryna do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin' rich s'posed to solve that
And these days, women make offers
And who the hell am I to say ?
My ex sendin' late night texts
'Cause she don't know how to let 
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin' in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear
Sayin' she should be the one I see every time that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Suburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old handprints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux, I don't really give a fuck
And we only gettin' older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
It's funny when you comin' in first, but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her, oh-oh
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones upFor my nigga Hush
Yeah, look
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention
Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin' bottles cuz it's ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin' and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shoulda won that
Nelissa and Wristpect, Man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin', ex-girls bickerin'
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'd take a minute if you're listenin'
Please start doin' you, I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin' me
My brother P-Reign knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver and 40, man you know the deal

"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song

If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands will say
They'll say
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need’s an address and I’m on my way
Don’t fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it’s worth waiting for
Because I’m on my way
Won't hurt, it's just some turbulence we're dropping
Dont be afraid
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
I'll keep you safe, so safe
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need’s an address and I’m on my way
Don’t fall asleep

Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my wayAll night I've, been staring, can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all nightUh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right, uh
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off your chest"
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attentionCan I, can I save you from you?
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you've been sippin's not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, yeah
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making a mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you
Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you
Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playing you just drunk. You just saying shit
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes and I'm just trying to correct it
And I fall...
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like youYou know, you know
You know, you know
Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in ’02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted 'til I'm out it
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know
You know, you know
You know, you know
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin' to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn’t what your motive is
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know
You know, you know

Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, "This just ain't my style"
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile for me, no
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before?
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Look, leave me, leave me, I can't fucking stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we 'posed to be together 'til the world end
But I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call, you just tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that? Do that, do that, yeah
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off

This metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
Y'all don't really know me if you know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that I stayed in
And I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin' at amazin'
Girls tryna SoHo lobby us, hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably us
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town?
Two or three days, I shut you down
Chilin' with the homie Trey Songz, you call him the prince, he rep two up, two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
And I don't ever really kick game, I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providin' that
Understand that I'm worldwide, you get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK and from Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans, but, yo, this hook is for my exes
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl

Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't, now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl
Ain't ya never seen a youngin' so fly? 
Lookin' for someone your type

Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl
With the other dudes she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and then they break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin'
Lookin' for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO
Sunshine and that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow

Let's goSpending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone, I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there
Come right in, set your bag down
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh

Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl

I been waiting for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So, baby, I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone
'Cause I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top, so let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl, I'm gonna turn the lights off, but keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what we're about to do
Come right in, set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
Oh, it's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studioYeah, oh no, I'm ready
Yeah, let's go
Your girlfriend at my next show, OVOXO nigga
Haha, yeah
Uh, wassup?
Real nigga doing real stuff
Get alot of money you could never get enough
And you know the new shit sound so tough
So and so just walked in... so what?
I don't really vibe with alot of these niggas
I ain't really into giving more than one chance girl
I already tried with alot of these niggas, fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that? That can't be from here
That can't be what they believing is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit, that's that fake shit
That's that top row of veneers
Just when they getting impatient is when I make a world premiere
Uh, damn, word?
Award shows coming? Make sure you spell that shit right
Make sure to give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff still in that Sprite
They watch us make the shit into the song
You ain't livin' that boy, stop stealin' that life
Anything can happen when I do see ya
Guess it all depend how I feel on that night
Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend, bitch better have my tomb right
Ah, this is perfect for the women that I loved before
I love em all, I just love me moreYeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin'
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!
Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is
And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
]
I miss you, most of all, my darling 
 Strolling in the park 
And watching winter turn to spring 
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to springR.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over

Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya
Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you wanted fast? Define fast
Cause I could speed it up and make it lastAnd I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed

Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed tooPlus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you

But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ahem, my name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over-stand me
I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit, like, "a-la-la-lollipop"
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I freak that pussy better
Better than her gynecologist, ho just
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick, old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damn, all I got is one dick
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got the talk, the beat and bass
Give me one, I'll take it, make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace
I break it, break it you can't stop me in this ra-race
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

I've come this far on my own, done a lot for myself
Where to now you know
But I just, I just tell myself this one thing
It was worth it, it was all worth it
And by this time I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit but they served they purpose
And I got verses, I got verses
My 16s should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah heartbreak Drake I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna' make all my goals for the future come overnight
God-god-god-god damn how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over watch a season of Flight of the Concords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But uh, tell me you surfin' let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes I swear to God girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Ford's
Ethiopian girl Ethiopian girl
With yo' long curly hair and yo' big ass bootay
Reading all them pro black pro female books
Just let 'em let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription a vision correction
I'm young and successful, I'm living perfection
And mayne if '09 is when I'mma see mine
Being cool ain't enough homie I'mma freeze time

She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her momma is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin' down
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix
Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit
I'ma just give it to you direct, instead of me throwin' this shit
You know you important and shit
You know I'm supportin' this shit
We used to do pornos when you would come over but now you got morals and shit

Please make the most of this shit
Don't just come close to some shit
I give you this bread, you run me some head
And then you go glow up a bit
She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business

Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit
Her daddy is not around, momma is definitely not around
She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight
She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her momma is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to sli-

Baka, he a star, but still around to burst a bubble
Bitch, you crazy, don't pull up at 3 AM to cuddle

Cashville, I got racks still, fuck the law
Presidential suite filled with Birkin
Wisdom tooth got Mollies and Perkies
Fuckin' with my gang and get murdered
Shout out to my city, they murder

Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now

Come on, stop playing
Nigga, you know this shit regular, alright
Nigga, shit I'm Mr. Everything, nigga, let's be real
Okay, a nigga been had that, been had
On some Jawar shit, been had, been had, been had, been had nigga
That nigga said he asked if it's a Prezi and Obama started laughing
Man, these niggas know the deal though
Free all my niggas, free Rozzy, free Flaco, Nutty
Shit, Keeda, Moneybag, free Lucc', Joe, D-Rock, PK, shit
Man, free all my niggas, dawgThis the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me
Yo, the city is mine  
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy
Yo, the city is mine  
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
After that, break it down

After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it downI’m performing tonight you know that shit gone be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact
My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trendsetting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
I’m it I’m it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish I'ma wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, Balmain blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It’s about time that you made it
I was bumping your songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can’t sign nothing 'til my lawyer get the facts and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it’s not about who you know
It’s just how you balance it
It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
It's how you start actin' when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
Uhh, ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in your starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A lot of people sayin' fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Ts
And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band don’t you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us
And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Sher
I’ll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel, I hope heaven’s prepared for whenever you there
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through your stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motherfucking Mario
Yeah and Polo isn’t at my session
Mr.Anticipation keeping everybody guessing like
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away

Nuh ShakeI forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
She could be good for me yeahh
That's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's starin' in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh
I hate getting, messages from you, from you
It's like you know the perfect shit to say
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
I hate getting messages from you, from you
Especially when you say you should've stayed
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh
Ooh, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
But I still text you back, say I miss you tooI just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her
Not only could I do better, but I know better
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?
Feelin' like Rae, same damn 'Lo sweater
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, Moetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Ain't nothin' like a bad bitch
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw
Like Bruh Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, "It's yours"
I know this shit is mine for the takin'
If I ain't in Mason it's some gay shit
Prolly why I don't react when you say shit
Half the times niggas don't even make sense
Know this shit is yours
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit
You know this shit is yours
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit
You know this shit is yours
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance
I took a little moment out to say this
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sureI got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, "Is that a rose?"
"You mean Rosé? Why yes it is"
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style, you're in need of ya own, manI've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
These days
I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think
About how I have failed
To change all of my ways
These days
Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another
These days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs
These days
I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming
These days
These days
I sit inside a chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars
These days
These daysI don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last 4 shows
I do one song and use four flows
She use to be a Christian before
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me & the salesman build a rapport so
He understands the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash only, transactions homie
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
I been doin this for years homie, thoroughly I thought it
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track admitting most of my Currency’s imported
But too late now, it too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker
Playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A real Menschkeit as they say he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present every regal member
The coalition, is so efficient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Use to record in the basement that rennie grew his piff in
When pops turned over the keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen 'til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, nigga
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I'm equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased is sound vacant
Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talkin bout the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for lifeI don't even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I'd like to ummm
I'd like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Guess I'll call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes you Aunt Viv
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive
But what you expect though
Kinda direct yo
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
Deceiving 
Deceiving 
Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that y'all believe in
Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling
You losing appealing
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
Deceiving 
Deceiving 
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too
Sayin' to my self you deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin'
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin'
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin' it
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
Deceiving 
Deceiving 
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man 
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk aboutShake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough cloud for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, "Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?"
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways
Cause I need drug money Who got drug money?
I am talkin "white Phantom sittin' on dub" money
I am talkin "cold champagne at the club" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb? 
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
And spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum
I fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from
Oh! Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity
To formally welcome you to this extravaganza
That I call Comeback Season
Hope you enjoy your stay
Drinks are on me, by the way, yeah
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise
Shout out to 40-40

PARTYNEXTDOOR - All I Wanna Know When I was young, younger than before
I never saw the truth hanging from the door
And now I'm older, see it face to face
And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place
And I was green, greener than the hill
Where flowers grew and the sun shone still
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
Just hand me down, give me a place to be
And I was strong, strong in the sun
I thought I'd see when day was done
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
Oh so weak in this need for youI got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon and I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon and I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I'm just more ready than...
You
Said you were done with me, fine with me I’m on the loose
Now I can do what I want, I can fuck who I choose
Not looking for love, that shit hurt, last time you left a bruise
Riding by myself blowing smoke in the wind while I cruise
Riding by myself, yeah
I’m better by myself, yeah
I feel like being alone
But when I’m by myself, yeah
You pop up in my head, yeah
That’s when you see the text pop up on your cell like
Come throught, come throught
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon and I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I'm just more ready than...
You
Said you were done with me, fine with me I’m on the loose
Now I can do what I want, I can fuck who I choose
Not looking for love, that shit hurt, last time you left a bruise
Riding by myself, blowing smoke in the wind while I
I'm flickin' my wrist like I'm a fisher
Diamonds on my chest like a bishop
And these lines right here ain't no pickup
These lines right here gon' really, really make you fuck
These lines really gonna make you numb like Chuck
This time is your time
I need to know if you're down
'Cause if not, I know there's more around
There's always more...
Yeah
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon and I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon

The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

Sit right here, next to me
What's up? Your talk is cheap
Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Boy, you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
You know I gotta ask—

Know you got some other cool friends that you never bring
New stories for you every time the phone ring
They don't understand, girl if anything you're everything
Oh lord, good lord, smoke a little, then record
You know Papi on the vocals, 40 on the boards
Call me when you feel inspired, never when you're bored
And have a real conversation with your fuckin' boy
With the fuckin' man, Mr. Lover-Lover-Man
How come everything is always on the other hand?
How come you ain't never busy when I'm busy
But the moment that I'm free
You always end up with some other plans?
How you make a good dude wait so long?
I don't understand why, that's some girl shit
And what you doin' in the bedroom with your clothes on?
I want you wearin' what you came into the world with
This is your chance to prove that you got the skill
Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
You said you could give me the chills
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Well it's all up to you

Hey, woo!
Girl this very, very moment, yeah

You so bad and you single, what's this I hear?
We ain't met yet, my name Drake
And I'ma take the world over, this my year
This I swear
Had my share of women that I been with
I'm young, can ya blame me?
I know you feel like a lot of things off-limits
At least let me describe what it can be
Be faithful, I'll do that
Nah, really, baby girl, I'll do that
'Cause everybody break up when they cake up
We can be the couple that'll never go through that
Yeah and if we ever fallin' off
I swear I'll remind you that
That we're not who they are
Now all I really gotta do is find you
Where you at?
From the east to the west
Scream for me if you my number one lady
Take a lead from the rest
You can go fast, speed it up for me, baby
I'm a G, what's next
One night with me would drive you crazy
One night with me would drive you crazy
When it starts, are you ready?
Take your marks and get steady
You know that it's about to get heavy
But she's a rider, a rider, my yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, be my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
Tell me how to locate you
I know satellites all breakthrough
But they don't ever lead me straight to
And I gotta arrive 'fore somebody take you
Know there's someone you don't mean a lot to
And he would hate to know that I got you
I even got a speech in my head
That I write and recite at the moment I spot you
"Hey there, your name is?
I like that, it suits ya
I'm young, but different
I'm not what you're used to at all"
If we stop at the same red light
I'ma celebrate the fact that I found you, girl
And I'ma ride for you too, as soon as it turn green
Wanna hear from my ladies all around the world
Where you at?
From the east to the west
Scream for me if you my number one lady
Take a lead from the rest
You can go fast, speed it up for me, baby
I'm a G, what's next
One night with me would drive you crazy

No love for these bitches I said this year it’s all business
It is a shame that a couple of ‘em are off limits
No offence to my nigga, it’s just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he ain't trippin’
I know I got a couple things that Lil’ Wayne dipped in
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Don’t let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I can’t let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it’s lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warhol’s for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like I’m driving into something
Bitches on the kid like I’m Iverson of something
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!Yeah
I been waiting on this one Charlie, for real
I've been waitin' Driz
I've been waitin', let's get 'em bro
Nah, for real

You don't have a drink, you're not drinking or what?
I got a drink bro
Hahahaha, I like that
I got my drink right here. Cheers my bro
Toast up man
Yeah, okay, yeah
Goldman Sachs, they wanna hold my racks
Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he the expert
I hear it in they tone when they address him
We way too connected
Tom Ford assistant texted asking if I want classic or double breasted
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories of how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier
I told you
You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never rushin'
My niggas really made somethin' from nothin'
Dodge sentences like they don't wanna discuss it, change subject
Got the Benny Yang chains rubbin', never tucked in
Waiting to inhale
Things that I own will sell at auction as proof we did well
My house museum-scale
The only skeletons here are the ones from the nights I raised hell
Make sure the staff are paid well
Make 'em think twice 'bout the stories that they tell
No one knows when the plan is hatchin'
I'ma let 'em walk on eggshells
Tiptoe, niggas better know
Wow, man like Drizzy Drake!
Yeah
Got his foot on your neck man
What time is it? What time is it? It's like two in the morning right now
Yeah, well it's real late over here
It's me and Charlie, that's it, you hear me? We got the whole building to ourselves
We got the building. Kill them again, kill them again Driz, kill them!
Y'all keepin' the score while watchin' me score
Y'all keep the awards, I'll take the rewards
If y'all goin' for fun, I'll stay and record
But if y'all goin' to war I'm there for sure
Wouldn't miss it
I'm living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors soundin' like New Edition
That's these guys
Us guys don't wear New Balance or Levi's
Key West retirement plan
Grippin' the Callaway club in my hand
Hittin' balls off of the balcony into the sand
Tryna see where they land
October Firm the new chain of command
El chico, this verse is the explanation for the large ego
100 mill' hands free like Ronaldinho
I go from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Take your pick, Brooke or Tanya
Both those shorties'd leave their GPS on so I can find ya
Drop location
Spring break trips, I'm in hot rotation
I took a lot of my brothers from B and E licks or the pot rotation
To ridin' shotgun in a Picasso painting
Tricks up sleeves, have 'em playin' innocent to get the shits I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and this I see
Before I ever seen this shit tatted on P and tatted on C and tatted on me
I speak truth and get to shatterin' dreams
So it's best to tiptoe, niggas better know, yeah
Drizzy Drake! You're an animal Drake! You already know that you an animal bruh! Animal!
I'm saucy!
Saucy! You just stepped out of the club straight into the booth like it's light. Tear up the ting in one take!
Showed up for you, you know what I'm sayin'?

My brother, you already know
Wow. And you know what it's like. You stepped out the club into the booth to prove to everyone why you number one bro. Why you got your foot on their necks!

Ayy bro, it feels like that's another moment there, you know what? Like, I got to say this to you on the real bro. The way that you've embraced British culture will be remembered forever. And the UK love you. The real G's over here, you know that bro. When you go to your parties, you see who's in your parties
Nah, you know what it is, of course
It's the certies

My brother, man. Foot on neck time
Yo, are these guys dumb? You see the big man Charlie too, oh my goodness
My brother Drizzy. I can hear these rappers' prayers man

Nah, I don't wanna hear no chat for the whole 18 about Charlie Sloth. Are you dumb? Alright. Jheeze, jheeze

Come on! You know I've applied for your passport, right?
Hahaha. I need thatNiggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this"
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boySomebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
Tonight I’m into breaking up
Somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone, 
I’m with my people
I know you love it
I don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby forget about it
Im headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it
My judgment's never cloudy
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I’m polite about it
Baby after you
I’ve had a glass or two so somebody remind me where I am
Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
Because everything's easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, still run the committee
NY forever nigga, DiddyYou've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet meIt's Drake 
VO 
Amir 
Hahaha, Voyce talk to 'em, man
Hi, I see you sitting at home
Nobody's calling you on the phone
Your girls out making a night on the town while you're sitting there all alone
I suggest you come with your crew
Y'all are looking for something to do
'Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little something for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you
Ladies up north represent representing
Ladies down south represent representing
When the mic is in my hand I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was Eric B For President, it's evident
She spend her summers in Jamaica and I love that
They say that she should be a model she's above that
She had a rapper break her heart, had to open her
So she don't even mess with rap, only spoken word
Well, I'm a poet so you know it's get her to going down
And after all this is my city I could show you round
I understand that the shit you facing is crazy
Let me hear your views on the situations in Haiti
Or sit back relax, vibe with ya man
Chill we could talk about Tribes in Sudan
'Cause you gotta understand if I said it then I meant it
I understand that you Afro I'm tryna get to your centric
That's why I got a bottle of Champagne and then I sent it
Over where you sitting, noticed, pretend you didn't
Along with the bottle was a note attached
Here's some tickets to my show you should go to that
And it's a shame money's something that you barely need to knock her
I'm tryna treat her right 'cause she barely treated proper
But you showed up regardless of late choices it's clear
You really came to kick it it with Drake, Voyce and Amir like
Hi, I see you sitting at home
Nobody's calling you on the phone
Your girls out making a night on the town while you're sitting there all alone
I suggest you come with your crew
Y'all are looking for something to do
'Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little something for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you
'Cause love 
You know that love is in the air 
I should feel it everywhere
So smile 
So smile for me one time and I guarantee we gon have a good time 
'Cause love 
So smile Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig
I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I don’t waste time, can’t you see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy’s fucking crazy
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig
Y-M, bitch, everyday
Two times on Sunday
Spitta!
Check your blinkers, baby
Check your blinkers, baby
Cause, to me, look like you’ve been turning right all day, yeah
Right my way, I got a boulevard, baby
That’s right, Cash Avenue
Wall Street gangsta
Carter, y'all
Why would I lie, yeah
I ain’t rich, bitch, I’m wealthy
Young, I talk shit til I die
Come kill me, nigga
Fuck you, no homo
She like it, yeah
Boy, these motherfucking glasses I got on right now
Are so motherfucking cold
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya digYeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart, girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart, girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'ma take this hat off, and I'ma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
'Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping 'bout trapping you's a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, 'cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
Yeah, they say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
No El' will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know meSo hard to breathe this air that we call love 
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive from love 
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try
So many tears I cried
But all for nothin' I’m afraid to say
Oh
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more 
I love you more than I love myself 
Lovin' you no more 
I just, I can't, I just can’t be loving you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin' to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now it's changed
My life, ain't the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me
So many tears I cried 
But all for nothing I’m afraid to say
Oh, oh, oh
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more   
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more  
I love you more than I love myself
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Can't you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more 
I love you more than I love myself 
Lovin' you no more 
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more 
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more 
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more 
I love you more than I love myself It's fuckin' losers like you that make me do what I do
Make me hate where I'm from, you as fake as they come
Everybody got guns, who the fuck gonna squeeze
Everybody got SARS, you ain't fucking with these
Why you wish to be ghetto, tell me what's it about
Why you tryna get in where I'm tryna get out
Why won't you just be yourself, why won't you tell us the truth
Like how you only load guns when you up in the booth
You ain't nothin' to shoot, you don't even exist
You just a fantasy, family as weak as it gets
And you ain't speakin' a bitch, cause I don't listen to chicks
I don't argue with broads, cause I'm really a pimp
But I will tell you this, as far as y'all are concerned
Pull out my Santa Claus, and make the holidays burn
You can call me the Grinch, cause y'all are nothing but Who's
Just another bunch of phony acts with nothing to prove
Now let the kids play like the rider's ride
We spendin' all day, these niggas idolize
They claim they want fame nigga so we decided
That we gon' make 'em some stars until the drama dies
But they can go back to they holes where they mama lies
Or write more lies about they drugs, guns or homicide
Funny, claim the thug life that they abidin' by
But run up on 'em, then they turn into the silent type, they wanna compromise
My niggas, we ride or die
And roll with them bitches that got they body right
These niggas ain't built, ain't got the body type
Time to break a nigga's spirit like the Amistad, tryna fool the audience
Feel the ambience
Stars in your presence, kings of the city are appalled by the peasants
Ain't gotta say names, we can all get a reference
Brains and the info from your broads in the west end
Masters, flowing staggers on bars
Nigga stay mad cause his swagger's on Mars
Y'all niggas ain't thinking we calling y'all 'tards
Claim you want war, okay, on guard
Ayo, hey you Mr. Rapper Guy
When you in the booth, tell me why you have to lie
Come on, spit the truth, all I hear is bang bang, hustle this, hustle that
But if you hustle crack, then where the money at?
No proof, Dr. Seuss, story tellin' when he rhyme, like
Once upon a time I was really on the grind
There's another lie, couldn't out-hustle me
Hatin' when it come to D, I can take you're starting 5
I'm only goin' at generic rap niggas that
Rap about ki's but couldn't show me 10 G's
And these nigga' dry snitching on they tees
Standing out, like a sore thumb to the D's
My nigga please, if you really had work
You would do what you do and wouldn't put it on your shirt
It makes my heart hurt when dumb niggas act hood
You ain't no hustla, just a nigga that can rap good
See there's a height requirement, nigga to mention my name 
How the fuck you little niggas didn't stay in your lane
Man you offered me a truce and I took it
Now I hear this bullshit so how the fuck am I to overlook it?
If this little nigga survive then it gotta be God
How the fuck are you a hustla with your factory job ?
And I don't get it, nigga I'm a fucking diabetic
And I don't usually eat y'all sweet niggas
Every time I see y'all retard niggas y'all bitch out
Waddup Roxx? now we cool? then you dip out
Talkin' all that bang bang shit, pull a clip out
Sayin' you a blood, next week you prolly crip out
I'm saying, we don't believe y'all niggas 
G-35, x5 nah niggas 
This here is a public announcement for my niggas 
No more goodnight, good mornin', goodbye niggas
I don't appreciate niggas sayin' my name in they bullshit
It's like putting a knife against the lyrical full-clip
Do shit on my own, I never asked for help
If I was rapping like y'all I woulda killed myself
And nah, this ain't beef, it's missing a few ingredients
Dog you ain't a general, stick to being obedient
Piggy back, that ain't something I had to do
Laughing at Drake? you should'a seen how I was laughing at you
I don't beef over little shit, angry? A little bit
Little niggas get little recognition you little bitch
I don't do the little subliminals, I'm addressin' it
And if Littles wanna get in the middle then I'm suggesting it
They called you a bitch, were tryna act out
They challenge 'em to a fight and then they back out
So tell me how the fuck I can respect you cats
If you a gangsta, then what part of the game is that?
Hey yo Aristo, I'm lost, can you tell me whats goin' on in the streets?
How it feel to count dough while you palmin' the heat?
And yes I asked for a 16, you did your 16
I heard that weak shit and only wanted the beat 
But fuck the money and the cars that I drive to set
And fuck the women that's lying to all the guys they met
And fuck the features on my songs and the deals on the table
Or basically it's fuck everything that you strive to get
And it's the room of resolution, I'm finishing it in here
If I copy Budden's flow, you mimickin' his career
And the same money we hearin' you giving to charity
You need to be giving to Littles to give him some clarity 
'Cause that's your homeboy I think he's owed that much
Tell him pressing 25 don't mean you sold that much
And Breana, I don't mean to alarm ya
But you need to get outside the car to shoot this video in Parma 
You act like you hood and hood niggas'll harm ya
And this is not hatin' my nigga we call it karma
But yo Thug Life, show me where the hammer be
Yes I took an L on my own and they didn't damage me
You try to cover up your lies like a canopy
And tryna pull 17 year olds down in Bramalea 
And we don't got it out for you
We just saying that don't nobody vouch for you
Nope, nobody thorough is willing to give a cosign 
And you don't even sell blow, you just blow time
You can't even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go fix parts at a tractor plant 
And listen here, Tetley Tea
You one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
You probably snitchin' in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you paying these women and I sex for free 
But dog, how did this start, how we get to this part?
We all got niggas doing bids "Mr. Wishheart" 
It's not cool to use another nigga's as a threat tho'
I said you a bitch, I heard a seven man echo
You saying I hustle, my source for currency coke
They saying you never moving it and currently broke
And you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime
Just so you can have something to say in you rap lines
They say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school 
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you
Lose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through
Tell them not to call and that's even if they require you
'Cause they the only people recording that wanna hire you 
With what I spend in a weekend I could acquire you
Some of them believe you got money you little liar you
But, I don't admire you, short niggas tell tall tales
Good riddance Aristo I just retired you!Who else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
Treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
I'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose
I don't get shit confused
I'm not with different crews
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes
We live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Tell me today's weather
I know they say they good but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If there's a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby, what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he's a hater baby he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lyin' to the kids, like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Mary's
But I ain't playin' high school games
Pulling McClarens through a McDonald's drive through lane
I'm too fly, keep it hip-hop like Afu Ra
Girl on that McClaren, you gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swordsYeahhh
Tay you know, you know I told you many times you my favorite rapper right?
I'mma start this off like you would do it
Uhh
Shout out to DJ Wristpect
October's Own!
Drizzy!
Hehe
Here I go!
Uhh
Look I stands out
So don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, ask Apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, "Hey bitches!"
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of O.V.O
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame
Because they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it
And all you talking ass niggas get over it
And all you people that be hating get over it
And all you women that I fucked get over it
And yea I'm turning 22 get over it
You know you got to hear my records get over it
My whole team getting rich get over it
I got the city on my back get over it
Get over it, get over it
DJ Wrispect
Little Brother
Pooh, 'Te
Big doe I see you homie
Yeah
I'm serious man, please, just get over it
Just for y'all I'mma keep it humble as a mumble in the jungle
Y'know what I'm talkin' bout
It's Drizzy
Thank Me Later coming soon
Just lemme live man
It's all I ask
Here I goIt's what you all been waiting for ain't it
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we gettin Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious ya'll gone steady be rollin with some jokers
And me I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise your self, go buy a costume
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms
 and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers a cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face like, "No speak-a la ingles"
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for ya'll ulterior motives
'Cause if you like it ya'll should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
Alotta ice, alotta cream like Dickey Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Mishy Me
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me
Slid in threw a Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex man is a hater officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I've done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flix
But at this point I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they pay me
Mr. betcha that's expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spittin' a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga keep your two cents I ain't tryna leave you broke
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry BondsI can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars, I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would've cared more
That's my only feeling inside whenever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
'Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a missus
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out? Do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'Cause I can't get you outta my mind
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't
I can't stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
Missin' everything you say
Missin' all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away?
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby '07 supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
'Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't
I can't stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
I can't stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you 
Wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
I can't stop, missing you
I can't stop, missing you
 I can't stop missing you
 I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop, missin' youThis tracklist will be live-updated during the 14th episode of OVO Sound Radio, which will be aired at 6pm EST on January 30th, 2016

I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elevated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo', converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, niggaCan I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you been sipping
Not suppose to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do 
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type 
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type 
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all 
I believe in people like you
Cause who am I to judge you on the past girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before
Uh look, dress hanging off your shoulder barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just sayin' shit
And you dance, dance all high, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait, no I get it
Girl I’m wit' it
I’ve been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn
I wonder why I never learn my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it’s the first impression
And I heard there’s nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it’s been a while and I swear that this one's different
That’s why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been
And I’m slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I’m just trying to correct it, and I fallThe first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was "Pon de Replay," and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called "Work."
Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.
Captivating from day one, the iconic being that is Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, that's often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.
When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style, she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.
What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.
This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one.
She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.Before we do this I just wanna say thanks man. Thank you for the years you spent working with some of Toronto's true legends honing your craft. Thanks you for dropping everything to work with me after we met and realized we had something special. Thank you for pushing yourself despite the fact you should be resting to achieve an end goal that we are both obsessed with. Thank you for listening to me vent and talking me off ledges. Thank you for talking me out of sending every good song I make to someone else 😂. Thank you for reminding me that we set out to do something more than just have the biggest song in the club or the biggest song of the month. Thank you for building SOTA. Thank you for caring about the people in this city as much as I do. Thank you for a lifetime of hard work and surreal moments. This story would have gone a lot different without you. Thank you 40 . Text me when you are ready to start the next one 😂😂😂  @ovo40Oliver Set

I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yeah
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up
Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama 
You're the only one
That's causin me this drama
And then expect favors 
When you come in town
And I know if I see you guaranteed it's goin down
Cause
Too stay with this girl 
You couldn't pay me!
I respect a woman
But this bitch is crazy 
This bitch is crazy 
This bitch is crazy

But this bitch is crazy
She don't even know
That's the craziest part right?
She just oblivious to the whole shit like
And you know like I was sayin sometimes
I gotta get my R&B on you know
I wanna wear the wife beaters
With the slit at the top so
I can tear it easy and all that
I wanna sing in the rain girl
You know what I'm talkin bout
Yea
I need a R&B name too like uh... like uh... like
I don't know I'll think of it
Hey!
Hahaha
You crazy man for real
Ho!
Oh well nigga fall back ho!
Goddamn
I said it without sayin' it manNobody knows what happened to forever
People come just to go and then it's like "Whatever"
But when we get close hands on your skin
You make it rain and I could just dive in
But why don't we both get a little wetter
We can get it all at once
Run, the river dry as hell and it be done
But trust me that's not what you want
Trust me that ain't what I want
I wanna slow burn hot with desire
Baby, hold up, don't blow at the fire
Slow burn, that's how I want it
Nah, a little sweat never hurt nobody
Corazón es el momento de enamorarnos a fuego lento
Y amor, tu movimiento hace que arda y me queme por dentro
Lento, a fuego
A fuego, lento
A fuego
No, don't blow out the fire
I know the taste, savor every second
And I know the place where I'm gonna get it
Don't let the rush, I like the chase
Steady, slow baby, this ain't a race
I know the we're close, you know where it's headed
We can get it all at once
Run, the river dry as hell and it be done
But trust me that's not what you want
But trust me that ain't what I want
I wanna slow burn hot with desire
Baby, hold up, don't blow at the fire
Slow burn, that's how I want it
Nah, a little sweat never hurt nobody
Corazón es el momento de enamorarnos a fuego lento
Y amor, tu movimiento hace que arda y me queme por dentro
Lento, a fuego
A fuego, lento
A fuego
No, don't blow out the fire
But we can get it all at once
Run, the river dry as hell and it be done
But trust me that's not what you want
But trust me that ain't what I want
I wanna slow burn hot with desire
Baby, hold up, don't blow at the fire
Slow burn, that's how I want it
Nah, a little sweat never hurt nobody
Corazón es el momento de enamorarnos a fuego lento
Y amor, tu movimiento hace que arda y me queme por dentro
Lento, a fuego
A fuego, lento
A fuego
No, don't blow out the fireDon't you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? 
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Why you over there lookin at me
While your man standing right beside ya?
The temporary happiness he might provide ya
But you know and I know, that nobody gon do ya like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line of sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly I'm kinda like
"I don't really wanna hit this girl"
And so she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'mma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playin around
It gets deeper and cold-ER, the funny thing is
I'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...
Don't you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? 
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Look...we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreat thing
But that was then, you know some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus your man still there, let's be fair
You'll do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past, some late night smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he!
Late night's 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, cause I been the other man
And you not gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan
It's my bad, shoulda chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl playin
I'm sayin, you need to do what you do
I'm not tryna take it any further with you, c'mon
Don't you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? 
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Uh...uh...I met her at the bar sippin on Patron
And now it's been three years off and on
Cause the same page, we are rarely off and on
Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone 
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb
But regained it while she was buildin her house a home
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that, she don't know what to do wit her life
Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute she mad at me, next minute it's all good
And I'm in her body like Gray's Anatomy
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do 
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, "Damn, if only her nigga knew", but...
Don't you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? 
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anythingUh, yeah, alright
Uh, well alright
Yeah, well alright
Uh huh, yeah
Feel good
It's a celebration, clap-clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscato
For the girl who's a student and her friend who's a model
Finished the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where ya tats is
Show me where ya hands at, maybe I can grasp it
They say if ya get her you can understand her better
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her
Yeah, and I got it together
So when they talk they try deter me it's like whatever
Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya
These girl groups with they overprotective managers
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place
Yea... but if you never even been there
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air
I know that shit is exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myselfAlbum: Drake - More Life

Back again like we never left huh
I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this
Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh
You can't just love me like they do
I need someone special in you
I know that out there theres a few
See I've been searching I don't what to do
Can you help me?
She gotta be special
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
You gotta be special
Cause you never know how people stick around
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh
You can just love me like they do
I need someone special in you
I know that out there, theres a few
See I've been searching, I dont know what to do
Can you help me?
Special
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
Gotta be special
Cause you never know how people stick around
Special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be
Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh
You can't just love me like they do
I need someone special in you
I know that out there theres a few
See I've been searching I don't what to do
Can you help me?
Special
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
Special
Cause you never know how people stick around
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yea my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

More time with family and friends. More Life.
 
I've still got vibrations to send. More Life.
 
They say that we could live forever
 
At night I pray it's true
 
I've done so much in my short time and still there's more to do
 
But if someone should come collecting
Sooner than we're all expecting
 
At least the life you lived was one for you
— DrakeCheck, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best
When I give ya what I give ya
When I give ya what I give ya
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that 
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that 
And when I give ya what I give ya
When I give ya what I give ya
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that 
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that 
And when I give ya what I give ya
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Henessy
Straight with no cubes
Take me where the women be
I won't lose
Drake take Patrón to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? they call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena
I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya
When I give ya what I give ya
When I give ya what I give ya
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that 
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that 
And when I give ya what I give ya
When I give ya what I give ya
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that 
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that 
And when I give ya what I give yaDrake Set

And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
And love, I don't mind feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm in the fresh and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
Cause mine is Polo, and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
You can call me professor
But baby you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
So you can work it off
Baby I can give you extra credit
But there's something else
Girl can I frisk you?
Search you body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
Its cause your hiding ?
And I'm going to sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it us?
Can I love you all of my life?Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!Please
D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Something spinnin' fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room, cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian
It's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down  I'm gettin' ahead 
Plus it's gettin' hot so I'm a take a seat instead 
I'm lucky I ain't dead  I'm on a rollercoaster ride y'all
We all of age and I ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin' me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I just set the 40 ups, and I got two blunts
Bagging sour diesel, stinking like I got a few stumps
I’m sipping on lean, while you got fruit punch
Getting faded like clothes, I’ve been washed too much
Man, smoking with the devil got me high as an angel
Blow a smoke ring over my head, it’s a halo
Wake up, and bake up, spend the whole day slow
Head in the clouds, but my face low
Ayo, I got them percocets, you want a percocet?
Yo' girl got some nice titties, yeah, a perky set
I purchase cess ‘cause everyday I work with stress
High while I’m driving, it’s like I’m triyn’ to work a jet
And I smoke like a choo-choo train
So I stay low-key like Ja Rule new name
And I can barely walk, but it’s all good and dandy
Man, I’m so high I need a pilot to land me
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin' me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded

Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket on my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, uhh, you staying broke
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no one my size
Whatever 40's smokin' 'bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, I'm taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause it's about to go
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest, I'mma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-pass is as valid as can be
I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she's smiling back at me likePlease beware of them that stare
They'll only smile to see you while your time away
And once you've seen what they have been
To win the earth just won't seem worth your night or your day
Who'll hear what I say?
Look around, you'll find the ground
Is not so far from where you are, but don't be too wise
For down below they never grow
They're always tired and charms are hired from out of their eyes
Never a surprise
Take your time and you'll be fine
And say a prayer for people there
Who live on the floor
And if you see what's meant to be
Don't name the day or try to say
It happened before
Don't be shy, you learn to fly
And see the sun when day is done, if only you see
Just what you are beneath a star
That came to say one rainy day in autumn for free
Yes, be what you'll be
Please beware of them that stare
They'll only smile to see you while your time away
And once you've seen what they have been
To win the earth just won't seem worth your night or your day
Who'll hear what I say?
Open up the broken cup
Let goodly sin and sunshine in
Yes, that's day
And open wide the hymns you hide
You find renown while people frown
At things that you say
But say what you'll say
About the farmers and the fun
And the things behind the sun
And the people around your head
Who say everything's been said
And the movement in your brain
Sends you out into the rainGirl, I hate the fast talking, fast walking, fast fucking, fast loving oh
Wanna move slow
Got a little liquor in my system, always been friends underestimating how far that that shit go
Leave a little room for me
Leave a little room for your imagination
You should just take time with me
Nowadays there's time but not anticipation
Oh oh oh
What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me
Nowadays you can't get enough of me
Loving me, loving me, loving me more
You loving me, love when you loving me
Oh yeah, yeah
What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me
Nowadays you can't get enought of me
Loving me, loving me, loving me more
You loving me, love when you loving me...
Oh yeah yeahSheesh, get some act right

The kamikaze doors with the Rotweiller gotta be
Get Drakeo some mud and you gon' meet a different side of me
I'm standing on hundreds in the booth while I ride the beat
Pippie Long Stocking head, flippin' through the pots and pans

And I ain't talkin' 'bout like, you know dashboards from no '02 Maseratis or no shit like that. I'm talkin' bout like, like, you know how the, 2016 GLE coupes, I'm talkin' about high speed chases and shit like where you just go crazy and just throw that thing in sport or sport plus or something. Like them old ass cars don't be havin' that type of shit so you probably wouldn't know what I'm talkin' 'bout. Like I'm really standing, like, on big banc uchies in the booth right now in these bullshit ass Balenciaga pay shoes and all that, nigga, and, yeah. But I'm fresh out, it's like 11/30/2017, my birthday tomorrow. I might drop it on my birthday or something. Broke ass nigga
I need to pick the rest of these hundreds off the ground. I'ma just grab all of 'em, I'ma just grab all of 'em at the same time. Niggas ain't ever seen no money, sheesh. Like you from Arkansas, Little Rock ass nigga. I'm just havin' fun. Pine Bluff ass nigga, hahaha
Little Rock, Pine Bluff-inian B
Bum!Hands are tied
Someone's in my ear from the other side
Tellin' me that I should pay you no mind
Wanted you to not be with me all night
Wanted you to not stay with me all night
I know, you know, who that person is to me
Doesn't really change things
I know you're scared of dating, falling for me
Shorty, surely you know me
Right here for you always
You know, I don't ever change
Right here for you always
You know I don't ever change
Right here for you

You know I don't ever change
Right here for youOh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, every thing big
Nails done, hair done, everything big
You gettin' ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spendin' hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you’re the fuckin' coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together
She got it all together
She dont need to help none
She got her own paper
She dont need you to taker her
On a shopping spreee
My girl is fancy, fly and free
For some Gucci, huh
For some Louis huh
She got the best of everything
You can never report a fancy girl like me
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, nails done hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat itI don't care what you done, I don't care where you been
All you got do to is look over your shoulder
And look where God has walked you from
All you gotta do is look back
Just somebody look over your shoulder
Look where you come from, look where you come through
I come through the storms and rain
Look where I come from, I was down but now I'm up
Look where I come from, by the grace of God
By the goodness of God, look where I come from
Remind me where I'm from again 
Yeah, that's right, that's right
Tryna suppress the stress, you know?
Got a family tree that needs watering
A father that needs fathering
A mom that would probably prefer the whole mother-daughter thing, but we still rolling, you know?
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
They callin' my name, just another day
Can't bend, can't break
Can't let it show on my face
All of my mistakes, right there on display
All part of my story, skin thick as my shawty, yeah 
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
Is everybody safe? Carrying the weight
Tell me what it takes to get everybody straight
The money in my safe, can't buy a clean slate
Clean isn't for me anyway
I don't want you to allow people to tell you that you are useless
Alright, alright, go ahead and tell 'em, go ahead and tell 'em
Because I want you to know, God told me to tell you this day "You are useful" 
You are valuable , and you are vital , to God
Vital, vital, on baby, on Bible
Remember what I left when I go
Remember what I said when I spoke
Please don't stand at my grave and cry though
I'm not there, they made it so I can never really die though
So please don't stand at my grave and cry though
Pop champagne, scream my words
Let me leave on a high note
And don't let nobody call me an idol
'Cause I was never sitting idle
And my people go where I go
Don't let nobody sell my house on the bridle
Worked too hard for the title
Worked too hard, where did life go?
Last thing I heard was Andre scream "Ice cold"
Past eight years feel like I had my eyes closed, blindfolded
Smoke before I make my decisions
That's how I take the high road
Say I never get alone time, that's a lie though
I'm still alone with everybody as far as I knowMan, fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Uh, uh, fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it’s six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout to all my Asian girls, Dim Sum
Shots came I don’t know where they descend from
Probably some bad hoes, I’m 'bout to take your hemp from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I’m just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don’t I got that shit the world, wanna hear again?
Don’t Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me, paint drying
I’m never tripping over anything that ain't mine
I’m hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It’s been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I didn't notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
And the kids wearing crowns over here and everything is alrightOliver Set

They say he wanted the bounce back
I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love !!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't explain myself, All this Love !!
Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love !!

Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope
Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hopeOliver Set

PARTYNEXTDOOR - Kehlani's FreestyleYou ask how many girls I been with in my life
I tell ya, "I stopped keeping count when I was 25"
I ask you the same thing, you tell me, "Seven guys"
But we both know that's a lie
'Cause if we countin' head and if we countin' drunken nights
Then that number that you gave just might be off by eight or nine
But it's still nowhere close to mine
Marcus prolly had to bring me straps like thirty times
He took over like four years ago when Courtne had resigned
I been talkin' sex with Courtne since like 2005
We been friends since junior high
Tough to enjoy the company and never cross the line
She's like, "Is it more than a hundred, with everyone combined?"
And I say, "Yeah, that's bein' kind"
At one point or another they all felt like they were mine
I had a lot of backs that I would never talk behind
I'm not really into threesomes, I like one thing at a time
I like when it's you and I
Plus I always feel like if somebody outperforms you
That could jeopardize your pride and I'm not into choosin' sides
Unless you 'bout to sleep and you askin' me what's my side
It's the right at home, but this a hotel so you can decide
Lessons that I learned before hittin' my prime
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
Things you need to hear 'fore we say our goodbyes
Free myself of it all, watch a Scorpio rise
Yeah
You say you wanna know but you don't though
Why you wanna know who I cropped out of photos?
And lately, papi, you been acting tonto
What you think before you, I was only movin' dolo
But I'm honest 'til I die, so I won't lie
And I prolly got some numbers that you won't like
And you're prolly gonna hate it
But I much rather be hated for the truth than for the wrong guy if he ain't 
You can't be this good without some badness
What? You think I fuck this good without some practice?
And if it's LOV and you're my MVP
Then why we talkin' about practice?
Like you want me to lie
Why would I jeopardize my worth, just to value your pride?
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
'Cause then I switch up and I blame it on my Gemini
Might be jealousy, 'cause you just want me tradin' lives
Jealousy, 'cause I can get the girls and get the guys
And if I'm honest, this whole convo's just a waste of time
'Cause legacy should be my focus, not here playin' wifeBetty came by on her way
Said she had a word to say
'Bout things today
And fallen leaves
Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes
Gonna see the river man
Gonna tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time
If he tells me all he knows
'Bout the way his river flows
And all-night shows
In summertime
Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure
For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more
Gonna see the river man
Gonna tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free
If he tells me all he knows
'Bout the way his river flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me
Oh, how they come and go
Oh, how they come and goOliver Set

They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
I pull up on you in that purple thing
Bumpin' Purple Rain
Singin' "Purple Rain," sippin' purple rain
Pourin' champagne off commercial fame
You ain't worth a thing, you ain't gang gang
You ain't flame gang, you ain't same gang

It's a different world, it's D'wayne Wayne, oh Lord

You don't see Tina right next to me
I thank her for takin' my breath from me
But the second me gon' be the better me
J.R. Smith with the shot
Cause I pull up, I stop and pop
I call my AK Barney and I'ma let this baby pop
Pull up on you like Steph Curry
With my foot up on you like eff worries
Been outchea since Keith Murray
Codeine got me with pink urine
So you know I don't have the energy
I fucked a bitch named Epiphany
My exes wanna be friends with my other exes
And I don't have the sympathy
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, doneIntro

Big Lean - StaminaLady, you say I stay in the house til four
We don't even go out no more
Its always the same eh
Always complainin
Its obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby
And people are shady
My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next
Lend me ya kleenex
I'm tellin you baby
I think I'm a bout to cry
Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you
I hope that I see you again... again
Hope that I see you, see you
Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
Thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good goodI did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere 
If I ever disappear , best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again 
On that same shit again , all I ever do is stunt hard
I tell her, I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who is he?"
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better than your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully I'll let them see what they say that I'm gon' be
And if not then I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet than to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane, pick a lane, that's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve, without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah, the Chris Paul of this fall
Sittin' this tall, I float high, goodbye, I will miss y'all
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear , best believe I'm comin' back
Stunt hard 
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again , all I ever do is stunt hard
If I don't do nothin', I'mma stunt my ass off
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil
You can't get on my level cause I am so unleveled
I'm a young rebel and I got a babyface
I need a young Pebbles, I need a stunt double
Yeah, me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles
Yeah, I stick my landin' in a freak drawers
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes
Yeah, but I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O, yeah
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious
Yeah, I'm on the cup of that tilt
And if you hatin' on me I'll say fuck you like wilt
Yeah! I'm a wilderbeast. You're just a wildebeest
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace
Yeah! Talkin big big shit
I am rude, I take food from a kid picnic nigga
Yeah and we can bang like bumper cars
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars, haha
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere 
If I ever disappear 
Best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard 
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again 
All I ever do is stunt hard
I stunt hard, I stunt harder
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans
I ball hard, So I'm a ball hogger
And I go hard in my dunk like Vince Carter
I hustle harder, I live in the Carter
I think forward, all I see is tomorrow
I need meat I'll turn your shop into a horror
So if you tryin' to see more, better feed me
I'm back on my grizzy like "Izzy" after "gr"
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur
And the feds will never get me like a backwards password
Black spur, ghost I'm like Pacman, Casper
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister
Ask her, am I her man? Her answer is yessir
Shit, I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA 'bout a quarter a day
Now tell them bitches
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear, best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again, all I ever do is stunt hardYes
I'm on that old, switch lanes shit, Jay, Big, Dame's shit
Talking 'bout them niggas that my daddy pitch cane wit
Because I never learned the biz, I learned the language
Well-spoken, man I should've went to Cambridge
And mama would always claim this
I never expected the outcome, but one day I became this
Famous, no longer nameless
More game, but I'm the same, I will remain this
I'm still focused, I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read 48 Laws if you never read it
Because that is one of the main reasons I'm level-headed
Despite the accumulated success
If my attitude ever strayed, I made it regress
I never wanted to win the lottery only because my uncle
Told me "He who made it by struggling made it the best"
So with that on my chest, I'm down on my last 12 gs
Going through the closet thinking I should prolly sell these
Chanel Cs, and LVs, somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all, who needs anymore?
Whose satisfied doin' good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore, who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me, that should have my whole race shook
Because we don't read novels but we do FaceBook
The new craze is havin' that new age look
If I said I liked it, I'd feel like a two-faced crook
Nah, I tell retro kids tie that bandana just a little bit tighter
'Til it suffocates you, biter
Cause I don't wear no bright colors or rope chains
I'm a G, my daddy was in the dope gameHey girl
Do you want my number
That way you can call me
Every time I come into town
And then I will
Drive up to your house and
Take you out to dinner
I dont expect nothin at all
Chorus:
But what if we happen to kiss
And we touch
Put a rush on it
And get it over with
Or what if I just know
What you like
And it feels right
Then its over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right
All this lasts
Just one night
Slow slow slow
Hey girl
I'm back in Atlanta
Second dates are lovely
This time you should choose were we go
Need suggestions
How about the movies
Mini Golf or ice cream
I'm not picky, you let me know
Chorus:
But what if we happen to kiss
And we touch
Put a rush on it
And get it over with
What if I just know
What you like
And it feels right
Then its over with
What if I don't call you back
Prove you right
All this lasts
Just one night
Slow slow slow

Chorus:

What if I don't call you back

Just one night
Slow slow slowI'm black and Jewish
Don't be so foolish
I'm black and Jewish
It's a Mitzvah
Please don't forget I'm black, please don't forget I'm Jewish
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is
Chilling in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer
Like Baruch Yitadel Yisrael
Ve'et ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy
Do not go to Feingold's, though
The pickles are rubber
And I will not be harming ya
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada
Daddy from Africa
Best of worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya
Challah!A day once dawned
And it was beautiful
A day once dawned from the ground
Then the night she fell
And the air was beautiful
The night she fell all around
So look see the days
The endless colored ways
And go play the game that you learned
From the morning
And now we rise
And we are everywhere
And now we rise from the ground
See she flies
And she is everywhere
See she flies all around
So look, see the sights
The endless summer nights
And go play the game that you learned
From the morningOliver Set

Trynna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour
Just to get that belt to fasten
All she wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Don't know where she going
But I do not plan on asking at all
Cause her spirit is free
And she, lets nobody else in except for me
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree
I’m the only one she loves
There’s no copies of the key
Homie, that’s a guarantee
Don’t forget that Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashin’
Other dudes would suffocate her, I don’t want her gaspin’
Don’t know where she’s going
And I do not plan on asking at all
I’ve never been the type, felt alike
My connection with niggas that wanna fight
Over women, that's not right
There's too many in the world
Homie, you can have your pick
But I swear that ones my girl
I swear that one’s my girl!Finally back in Toronto, it's better here
I just wanna be anywhere but everywhere
I'm being lazy at the crib kushin' it up
I get enough exercise just pushing my luck
Sitting back thinking damn where did they go
They used to be the ones to watch Ricki Lake show
And now I see em picking up the pieces
One too many starting over speeches
I guess it’s back to me like it always was
Me and the OVO set like it always was
A little money on the counter I left for my girl
With a note I’m trying to see the rest of the world
It all looked so amazing when we were growing up
Used to sit back and say I know I’ll get a model one day
But all the money and the rap game slow as fuck
And all the models from the hood, Project Runway
Yeah, it’s whatever
You know
Feeling good
Living better
But it’s evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you just gotta cherish
Like this young girl had my lyrics tatted on her arm last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I been here before, huh?
Yeah, I still got ten years to go, huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alrightDrake Talking/ad-libing:
Its Young Money Baby
I got something for these niggas to ride to
Fa'sho
Here I go
Verse 1:
Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woo to the bangers
Su-woo to the bangers, 
And I say, I be on some G shit
I be on some G shit
Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
Im me bitch, I said I'm me bitch
Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG
---Guitar Break---
Verse 2:
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love
Cuz I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where its at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract
I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggas for that Louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch
And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG
---Guitar Break/Breakdown/Solo---
Outro Verse
I a'int have sex in a long time x3
Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I a'int have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight
Let me do me, you just do you
Im double cupped right now
Su-woop to the Still...
Whipping the chevy, still getting my tipped licked
When I'm ready I still fall off intheparty like confetti
It's still mad rappers, D. Dot Angelettis
Still just as skinny as you met me
Still keep it real, never will let another disrespect me
For real, til deep in peace they rest me
Still smoke cess cause I swear that they stress me
And when I'm home a lot, keep the chrome a lot
Cause even when I'm home I'm knowin' there ain't a lot of dudes
That don't like the fact I'm blowin'
Like some running shoes on the track I'm goin'
Tell these other dudes they slack I'm sewin'
Don't get hemmed up, I think Timmed up
Cause in my mind it's the winter time all the time
I'm a grind
Tell em I'm a rhyme, told em that this sing got me signed
Try to put me in a box I will not stay there
And if I fall I will not lay there
Grown man, this is not daycare
A big boy game, they do not play fair
But I still keep it trill and I got this chair
Still uncomfortable if cops is there
My fam still dysfunctional, we not repaired
Still got rhymes out the asshole
Still wonder why are they mad for
Cause I'm in the hood like the crack-ho diesel
Ask yo people, Trey still do it for the people
Ride with some inter straps your whole fucking car is illegal
Still pick good over evil
Still play the Jesus and it's wild cause I'm still sinning
Addiction still weed-puffin, giving it to women
It's still my brain ready to bust up out my skull
To the mic, cause my mouth to be saying shit right
They saying shit like, I don't be killing it
You niggas is ridiculous, eat a dick or some syphilis
Die slow, still I done sucked it up
Drake tell em what the fuck is up
I used to cut the porch lights on
And now I cut the Porsche lights on
Just to let em know their foresight's wrong
Where this nigga going with that obscure ice on
He a lame, I'm tryna get my mature life on
I asked what happen, or whats hattenin', hattenin'
Hop up out the passenger and help me back the phantom in
Damn, I never got to use that in a convo
Never got the chance to put you back in a condo
And, and, it couldn't be more true
I always meant to get you that villa in Corfu
Women I pass off, and money I tore through
Now all I really need is the number before 2
Is it over, tell me it isn't over
They told me it was easy as I get a little older, yeah right
And this is what my life outro sound like
Even though Dre did it this shit don't sound right
I was, born to do it, born to make bomb music
I flow tight like I was born Jewish
Well, actually I was born Jewish
I guess at this point you could say I was born foolish 
Yea, what about the grammy's and the bubbly
What about all my fans that be loving me, I
Used to chill in them spots where the trouble be
But never ended up in that menage at the Double Tree
What about that girl Rita down in Basque
In L.A Swear I would of never cheated on your ass
But you ain't give me yo number cause them niggas got to fighting
Situation got me thinking and that's when I got to writing, hmm...
Change these hundreds for me cashier
Cause I ain't made it but I'm better off than last year, yeah
And what it look like hun'
I never got to make it rain but it look like fun
And, uh, a king is what I'm fit to be
I don't get these niggas, they a mystery
I mean they talk so quiet as if it its private
And they don't ever bring that shit to me, but
Man I ain't live life so wrong
I said fuck a couple dudes, cause I ain't like yo song
Least let me tell you why I'm this way
Hold on...And I know
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story, yeah, real bad karma
Condo in Miami, sold that shit to Chalmers
I stay on the beach when I retire
I can't miss a game, I been on fire
I'm thinkin' money when I sleep now
That's the only thing that get me geeked now
Someone got a problem every week now
Oh, now, they talkin' beefs, now
Gotta make peace and stay a hunnid 
All my girls bad, times a hunnid 
And I'm going hard, times a hunnid 
I'm tryna see a hunnid, times a hunnid
For the guys, for the city and the gang
I might appear if you keep calling on my name
Put a curse up on you, things are getting strange
You ain't lie when you told me that I changed
And I know
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story, yeah, real bad karma
Aye, 2 A.M. with my departure
Jug out to Miami, flew in charter
Stay one hunnid, look at me I've been in charge 
Oh, you know I'm 'bout to sauce on you 
Suggest you lighten up, I might go dark on you 
Hey, pull up, pull up, skrt, vallet park on you
Ayy, King Kong, climbing up the charts on you
Oh, goddamn, say my life is full of drama
Hot boy, I feel like Dwayne Michael Carter
Life been good since I became a father
Thought you said a kid would make it harder
No-no-no, trust me it just made me smarter
I cut some niggas off, put some real ones on the roster
Never mix the real niggas with the impostors
Keep them niggas far from us, I say, "Fuck 'em all" 
I say, "Fuck 'em all"
I just checked all my accounts and my money sittin' tall
Nigga, shut your fuckin' mouth, ain't no need to air you out
Niggas know what you about, heard you goin' through a drought
Must be why you talkin' down
Boy I know
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad storyOliver Set

Bitch I'm eatin' lavish, look up, ho, it's snowin' now
I just throw the cabbage, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League gon' hold it down
Got a odor there in the attic, that's a couple pounds
New Rolex that I ordered, that's a hundred thou'
Time to milk the game, bitch I went and bought a cow
My nigga GDK a goon, he'll gun you down
Slid up on him with the stick, yeah and sat him down
My nigga Nut so slick, they ain't pat him down
I got a hundred niggas on my line
A hundred squares at a time, nigga, hold it down
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
Alright my patience runnin' thin
Olympic pools of money, I'm just glad I learned to swim
Cannonball, bitch, I hope your diving board's sturdy
And I hope when dinner's cold, my niggas do not desert me
Nah, but shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And these haters pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person, man I wish y'all would
I say you lucky if your father was a figure
Cause my uncle was my father and my father was my nigga
And my mother so proud cause his son is gettin' bigger
I took time to load the bullets, now I'm 'bout to pull the trigger
Like boom, boom, boom, I'm a genius, god dammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Skinny told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
Yeah, nd to my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname Starter-Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other lames is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crackI swear to you Lord
Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between
*Back against the wall like a plasma screens*
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and e'ry night is New Year's
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin'
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And it's cool if you spill suttin it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colour only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin' today
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move, sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm giving away
You feel me?You goofy ass niggas better show me my respect
I'm dranking on this yellow 'cause I ran out of the Tech
A nigga want my jewelry, it's okay, I got a TEC
It's roll bounce on my neck, roll bounce on my neck bitch
Roll bounce on my neck bitch
You pussy ass niggas better show me my respect
I'm dranking on this yellow 'cause I ran out of the Tech
A nigga want my jewelry, it's okay, I got a TEC
It's roll bounce on my neck, roll bounce on my neck bitch
Roll bounce on my neck bitch
Listen lil nigga, life is like a game of chess
It's Pippi Longstocking and it's in the F&N
Benjamin Franklin ain't never been your friends
We standing on the table, you can tell who got the bands
A flu flamming nigga, I ain't never been a scammer
I rock out in Givenchy when i'm playing heavy metal
Off a five and a perc, got me dancing with the devil
Want the demon, get the shovel, you be lyin' to these cameras
Tag Rolex with the forces, you on fake lean busters
My neck C-walking, you'll be dead, keep talking
Niggas in these bets, it's a mystery to find 'em
I'm flu flamming diamonds, got 'em from another climate
You goofy ass niggas better show me my respect
I'm dranking on this yellow 'cause I ran out of the Tech
A nigga want my jewelry, it's okay, I got a TEC
It's roll bounce on my neck, roll bounce on my neck bitch
Roll bounce on my neck bitch
Let me know somethin', I ain't playing
Step up in the function, damn this lighting is amazing
Scuff marks on my shoes, I'm flu flamming in these Maisons
I told her, "If you love me, baby, show me with a payment"
Two milli on my views, I freestyled on "Impatient"
That's Drakeo and the Stinc Team, god they're amazing
Need cash money baby, I'm codeine crazy
Niggas wanna play, brains plastered on the pavement
Attention ain't here, well this is history in the making
Talking igloos on my neck when I'm skating
A blizzard on my neck, damn baby can you take it?
Nickname me Mr. Maison, damn
You goofy ass niggas better show me my respect
I'm dranking on this yellow 'cause I ran out of the Tech
A nigga want my jewelry, it's okay, I got a TEC

Nigga all this shit regular

Like damn baby, I'm like turn that LED light off
Like that motherfucker was just
Boom ba, boom ba ba ba, foo flam, fo flam, oh ooh, ooh bam

Su-woop to the bangers
Su-woop to the bangers, 
And I say, I be on some G shit

Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch
Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love
Cause I don't have the time for thatt
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract
I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggas for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch
And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG
I a'int have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I a'int have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight
Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woop to the Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
It's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a "nigga"
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist
Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna question half the places Nick beenI've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride
Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when "fuck bitches, get money" was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single
If ya'll don't like me then 
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man 
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that 
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm whats wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like 
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know
Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker
I'm in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the grain and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice
Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica
I say 'baby get low', You just getting by
They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try

Here we Gooo
The 1st time around
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhyme-in Now
I'm seeing it clearer, the season is nearer
And still I must change, I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm out spoken still
They not sure it'll work but their all hoping
He'll emerge the victim, my words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that you heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin' before ya'll
I barely get tired, I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week is What I'm daily required
I'm meetin' quotas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova
Be in the throne instead of being ya own
But look
Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin' on the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go
It's like I'm makin' moves in my city though
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin' to get with me though
Important and vital
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not
Play me
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin' the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh
Look... I got few days left
And I'm a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We handin' fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin' up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up

They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though
I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my  
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
 
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like �I ain't getting service in your area�
You be like �Nigga get your bars up�
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby! 
Look

Then you went and found one
How you gonna get it bad?
She can't help but get attached
See me when I'm outside
See me on the South side
I could tell you're sick inside
'Cause she just wanna love me, she don't wanna leave me
She just wanna love me, she don't wanna leave meThat shit was wack as fuck
I was like, 'You won. Why are you posting your text message? Just chill. Take your W, and if you feel you didn't deserve it, go get better — make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?
This is how the world works: He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. Whether people wanna say it's racial, or whether it's just the fact that he tapped into something we can't tap into. That's just how the cards fall. Own your shit
To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you robbed everybody. We all need text messages!Lord, keep me away from these bums

You need more girls, go call my manager
Two, three, four more, sure, we can handle ya
Gimme e'rythang I want, don't mess my order up
And her ass on point so my homie brought her up
Ma passed me the blunt, then I told her pour it up
In a flash we was gone, and you know I tore it up
Breast, ass, silicone, sex hot as Florida
South Beach, mouthpiece could swallow a Porterhouse
Yup, it get nasty, then I get gully
Grab the coochie, then the Gucci skully
A whole pack of rubbers, then I burned rubber
You cuddle undercovers, tellin' her you love her
When it come to verses, swear that I'm perfect
Murder in the first it's chllin in the hearses
Worthless, singing off key on purpose
We gon' pop, fuck urban

I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Drizzy
Aww yeah Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough will solve ya problems, too much will kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all is still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all that's why I strive for it
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I want the money, money, money, I want a whole lot of that
Cause all the honey's, they ask me where the dollars at
Where your head at? Tell me 'bout your scholar cap
Tryna find a way, but you never got a map
Dream chaser, risk taker
No favor, don't hate us
They might want me to drown
Holdin' me down but the throne and the crown
Is all I ever wanted, all I ever needed
If I'm the only one then don't nobody else believe it
Then keep it a secret and watch me achieve it
Cause I know what I want now!
So if you want the money, if you gotta make it
You the only one and don't nobody else believe it
Then tell 'em to beat it and watch you achieve it
Sing it if you want!
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
I suppose, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left somethin' in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2"
And 48 hours all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got po'd up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantoms leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress is like a dead end
My girl love me but fuck it, my heart beat slow
And right now, the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week so
It's good but I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want the—
I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
The oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
Whoa-oh-whoa, I just wanna be, I just wanna be successfulClown ass niggas, I peep all them subs and all that
Niggas can't fuck with me nigga, I do this
I am this shit nigga
And don't be commentin' on my pictures, I don't know you niggas
Pippi Longstocking, huggin' on my denim
All up in my business, 'bout to take the beetle
Call me Mr. Whiskers, the flu flamming champion
Bitch, I am the Ruler, back splittin' medullas
Medusa, I stone him if he Judas, he stupid
Think he finna book me, I am not one of these losers
The kamikaze doors when I'm hoppin' out with two TECs
Ooh, damn, flu flam, nigga think he too tough
Klu Klux, quick to hang a nigga for my Luther
All these niggas know me, Mr. Big Bank Buddah
Or Mr. Big Banc Uchie
I don't know nothin' 'bout no murders
I don't know nothin' 'bout no killers

Pussy nigga you disgust me, please don't discuss me
Baby bottle when I'm fussy, ten bands off of musty
I ain't talkin' 'bout the song
I be sendin' ten packs every week of that strong
Get 'em in, get 'em gone, don't be playin' on my phone
Eight-balls eyeballed, and I serve 'em all night long
Poured a four of the pint 'cause the deuce wasn't strong
I don't go back and forth, bitch this ain't ping and pong
I don't know Nathan about nothin'
But I know every nigga with me gon' be bustin'
I ain't fightin', I ain't fussin'
We ain't talkin', bitch we fuckin'

I don't know nothin' 'bout no murders
I don't know nothin' 'bout no killers
The only thing I know is what I know and mind my business
These niggas eyeballin', I'm assumin' they offended
The Grinch that stole Christmas
I don't know nothin' 'bout no murders
I don't know nothin' 'bout no killers
The only thing I know is what I know and mind my business
These niggas eyeballin', I'm assumin' they offended
The Grinch that stole Christmas
Like I was saying, I don't know nothin' 'bout no murders or no killers
Like keep my name out your mouth, I don't know you niggas
Like for real these niggas run they mouth like
I'm talkin' like crazy shit, I'm like I don't know now nothin' 'bout no murders, I don't know nothin' 'bout no killers
The only thing I know is what I know and mind my business
For real, shit
Anyway through the work, 'cause is for real, I cannot have or, have access to firearms or some shit like that
So I don't know nothin' 'bout no murders
Stop asking me, I don't know your homie, uh, bitch
Keep my name out your mouth
And just listen to the tape though
And I don't know you niggas
I really don't, like
They done found the red, it was over here
I found itTime has told me
You're a rare, rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind
And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For someday our ocean
Will find its shore
So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love
Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn
Your tears, they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say
And time will tell you
To stay by my side, oh
To keep on trying
'Til there's no more to hide
So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love
Time has told me
You're a rare, rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind
And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean
Will find its shoreOliver Set

Do that dance. Do that Dance
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'mma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
 
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh
Yeah because you special baby
Yeah this the remix right here
Yeah Trendsetters
Drake, It's Southern SmokeLook, here we go
The first time around
I left the cars at the house and I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its about the rhyming now
Im seeing it clearer the season is nearer
And still I must change
Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm outspoken still
They not sure of the work but they all hoping he'll
Emerge to victor my words are pictures
And guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture
With 4 walls give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I've been thinking before y'all
I barely get tired I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week what I'm daily required
I meet quotas while you rappers having sleep-overs
Spending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova
Be in the throne instead of being your own
But Look
I'm making moves in my city so
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though
Important and vital I'm caught in a cycle
This is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain it, my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats a screw face
Rappers befriend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace
Thats why I tuck em in not giving a fuck again
D.R.A. you add a K.E
A couple mill and you labels cannot play me
I never go broke I'm far from a flash in the pan
I am a passionate man, plan it with cash in my hand
Uh
I got few days left
But I'mma make use of every single one until every singles done
Until every record is sold, and every string is strung
Tell me take a breather Drake and everything will come
Dog its always been the same
Its all love like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in the driveway
I roll down strips and hose down whips
That when turtle wax up they would close down Richmond
With no down shifting
Haters would say I'm adequate
Think I got the type of flow that would make an addict quit
21 years I've been pimping since being
Repurchased trap music 4 times since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince
Getting pennies for my thoughts
So I put my two cents in
Top of the morning I am dropping the coin in
Plus I'm changing the game
You hear me swapping the joint in
They put the fires out and bring the buyers out
And try and box us all together before they buy us out
If they profit from the events we handing flyers out
Then we profit from the attempts to hand desires out
But rich is how we all ending up
I'm at the label in the elevator send them upPart 1: Faithful
Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a
Not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me 
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed 
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game 
This ain't no motherfucking '91
We out here rapping for money you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
You hit me like “I know you’re there with someone else"
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax 
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
Talk like you bet it all on me
And you can’t take no L’s off me
I know you been...
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
How far we go
Always seems to get better with time
Won't you, outsmart me
Told me that your brain works better than mine
Tell me I should know you
I got to know you again
You want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
Now we're in the zone
Gon' let me all in again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again
Over and over again
You tell me I should know you
But I'll get to know you again
And you want me to show you
I'm gonna show you again
When were in the zone you
Gon' let me own it again
And now you're coming over
Over and over and over and over and over again
Now you're coming over
You're coming over
I wet all the floors of your ego
Feel like I was slipping away
And you know that I ain't gonna go, ain't gonna go nowhere, nowhere
Cause some of these things never change, no, no
I know that you know, that you know, you know that's it's true
There's a lot on my mind and you bother the times that I matter with you
But we keep it way more way more than, way more than 100, we keep it 110
Show me what I gotta do
I know you been working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
And before you leave here 
And until you do babe 
Ain't about me no more 
Tonight I'll make sure 
And before you leave here 
But before you do 
It ain't about me no more 
Make that sure you 
Part 2: Make Sure
Get you on top of me
We can do this still properly
Get your hands in the air, do your hair back
You're like a winning ticket off the lottery
But you don't, yeah, you don't want to start on me
Yeah, you don't want to start with me
But you should, keep shaking that in front of me
Unless you're down to do this publicly
You know, you know you gon' get comfortable
On the  rug with me
And I fuck with you
So if you really fuck with me
Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you
And she hit me with that "I don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions"
Let's see what's next then
And it makes so much sense now 
Girl it makes so much sense now 
You know that I'm gon' make sure now 
Make sure, make sure  
Make sure, make sure 
Make sure, make sure 
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure 
Make sure, make sure  Oliver Set

Tame Impala - EventuallyThis here is on some truthful shit
Its seems like everything I do your use to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with!
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damned
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I can't even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new girl
This here on some remix shit
Seems like ever thing I do they leakin it
And I hate hearing stories of who im sleeping with
I swear I got to hide what I got in my ride
So she still think im confident and damn
How long will this last
My life is on the pedestal, am I moving to fast?
Feel like im in crazy competition with my past
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything im doing brand new
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Remix baby if he can do good then I can do better
Dont blame me if any man would if he knew betterand dont won't to here about him anymore
But I know you heared this song before..
Is anything I'm doing brand new
Is everything I'm doing too late
Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed
On the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late?
Is anything im doing brand new?
Brand new brand new
Show me if this is brand new, new
Ooh ohh yeah yeah yeah
And this is the remix baby weezy baby,drizzy, yung mula babyAll alone
Guess again
You've been known
To take the hand of any man
Who will fill your fantasy
See you there
A big mistake
You're the pride
Of every fake that comes around
This messed up town
You know, and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You know and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You find out we've been lying, cheating
Baby
Give me a sign
Give me a reason
Make up your mind
Darling, only a fool
Couldn't see through us
Know what we do
Just because
You're a fan
Doesn't mean
You've joined the band
And found a way
To make them think that
You're a star
Silly girl
Only I can fool the world
It's plain to see
Cause you're just like me
You know, and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You know and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You find out we've been lying, cheating
Baby
Give me a sign
Give me a reason
Make up your mind
Darling, only a fool
Couldn't see through us
Know what we do
You know, and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You know and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You know, and I know, and I know
It's always better when
You find out we've been lying, cheating
Baby
Give me a sign
Give me a reason
Make up your mind
Darling, only a fool
Couldn't see through us
Know what we do
You know that it's true
The things that you do
I'm out of my mind
In love with youLove's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone
Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy Omar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot
With the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Alisha lately
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone
Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
Circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like Macgyver
Cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple a years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone
Check
And nowadays some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing
Her reputation's in jeopardy
Cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is goneUh, yea, get in my Slick Rick mode
N'a mean?, I'm a tell ya a Story real quick
Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a...
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself
My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin' directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it
I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself
And I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
Say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
Accept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
You know as a person man. I love to see my black women strong, single
Independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
Video you n'a mean? its a wonderful thing baby. so uh, don't hate me for
This one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? cuz its like uh
And she beautiful and honey dances
And you always downtown making money transfers
And anything the color of braces she get excited
She always showing up at these places she get invited
She a video girlVerse 1: Drake
I always wonder why you bother putting makeup on
You don't need it
And even though I always tell you that you're beautiful
I'll repeat it
Cause I don't want no singer, I don't want no model
And I don't want no fashion designer or nothing
I just want your love
I promise you that's more than enough for me
Chorus:
All you gotta do is come real
Shawty what the deal?
Dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way 
Verse 2: Kyoko
Baby just because I wanna look good
Don't mean that I ain't real
Not in the least bit
All the clothes and doing of my hair, face, nails
Make me feel good
And I'll keep it up
Im not sayin what you been stayin to me
Ain't exactly
What I need to feel and know
You're the one I'm wearing for
And where I'll always go when I need a real love
Kyoko Chorus:
So stay real
What you make me feel
Is true beauty of the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way Uh, What up y'all? Yeah
Soundtrakk, what's popping baby?
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here, I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out, uh
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week, he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, uh
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick
And push
And coast
Uh, uh, uh
What up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check
My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barely remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would've done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
Luckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse
So every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
And plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
So now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
Playing chess, looking through some old school record ads
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
And now I coast clear, take a deep breath
Feeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
This is each test life's ever given me
A-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a
Kick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
The kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
Think it's obvious that they need my soul
My cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"
She said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"
So I kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push Coast
Fast as the wheels replaced
I gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
So I kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Coast
Peep the way I roll
Just a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
So I kick Then push
And coast
Yeah, yeah
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said "There's no skating here"
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's kick, uh, uh
And push, yeah, yeah
And coast
Ah ha, SwankyShit I'm still talkin' that shit and she still hate and all that

And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it ain't a Buick
I never rendezvous it

Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the fuck you wanna do it
My nigga you better do it...do it
I would say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long

I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drop it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
And girl I heard your man a fed, don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city, got 'em open like the lock is gone
Keys out, I ain't talking white though
Baby what you be's 'bout

Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot

And I know that I'm just a boy that a woman can make a man of
So make me one, I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when she's 81
Please don't give it all away
I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around the more jaded that they become
But this one's special
So I make sure that my suit'll fit
The one my daddy wore in June of 85
I'm too legit
I'm just trying to get her in the mood
And have her doing all the things she'd only do when she get married
So let's do this shit
Tell the reverend all we're missing is his blessing
Because before she pop the pussy she need me to pop the question
So we exchange vows
They clap, we take a bow
And she'll be doing tricks for daddy
When we take it to the houseOlivers Mix

Drizzy
Taz You ain't even got nothin to worry about man
Check
Yeah
Are you listening?
Is anybody listening?
Walk into a room and you can smell the Clive Cristian scent
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrillin bars you think I'm writing with John Ghrisam
Pen
I need Rose, nevermind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom no license
Fuck if you're feelin me as long as your wife is
No one in my city gotta pocket like Drizzy
I can rock fitted Jeans cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentials
And Ms. Rhone sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck ya rappers and your self-proclaimed status
I can only see green now happy St.Patty's
I know you waitin on a last quote
Check the soundscan and you can see that I'm the last hope
By the way I'm Jewish and turnin 22
Get's depressing when you see your favorite rappers
Goin through it
Tryna re-invent themselves, showin' no improvement
Gettin' crushed by this light skinned young'n on some
New shit
40 just recorded and who dropped this here
Cos I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
And you are in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Fuck you really know about a Eames couch
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake, but a nigga's livin' ya dreams out
Lookin like a photoshoot everytime the team's out
And is the realest nigga still I
A woman could love me to death but I'd still die
So I'm about us now

Damn a nigga never switch
You should get your cherry bust
Before you fuck around with this!
I buy some Rolexes and pass 'em out as gifts
And when they tell me that's too much
I'm like "No, fuck it, I insist!"
And then we light it up and reminisce
About the things that we would fix
How the fuck we got this rich?
This is just some inspiration
For young niggas on they shit!
This for my young niggas on they shit for real
This also for the hood stars that I created
Whose booking rate went up right after we dated
Girl you made it for real
Hosting parties with athletes or another rapper
Then they trying to fuck you after
Remember when you was my....bitch!?
My special friend with benefits
You remember how you got here?
Hope to God you ain't forget
But the look you're giving me tells me you did
Empty stares across the club
Like y'all don't recognize the kid
But damn, you know what it is
Cameras flashing over here, I know that's something
That you miss, yeah
It been bad, and it gets good

I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
'Cause we can do that!
Uhh, focus on women then you get less done
It's light work, flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think being broke is less fun
Celebratin' Father's day every day so don't get sonned
Where you tryna go, I'm ready
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm standing on these couches sayin'
"Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch!"
Pardon me, that was rude
If you just started balling I say I'm 'bout to conclude
What more is there to do
And why I would pretend
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND' 
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
'Cause we can do it!
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do that!
'Cause we can do that!
Yeah, look
Me and 40 whilin', stylin'
Somehwere on the island
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And I'm callin' your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my dialin'
Never embellish, believe 'em 'cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previously exist
I wonder what I be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your old man?
He couldn't have done it like this sho' nuff
I tend to dro puff
I'm throwed and I'm high
I guess I'm throwed up
Tone it all down
My nigga grow up
And tell me when you start getting paid to show up, damn
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do
And then we do it!
'Cause we can do it!
I got friends with money, and I got money too
So we put it together and let you pick what to do

My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I doOliver Set

We in hoodies and timbs
Out on the grind
Rain or shine
Nickels and dimes
I'm out tryna to get his paper
I wake up, got money on mind
And I can't get off so I got to get on my grind
Got to get all my ducks in line
My bills in order crackers taking orders
For niggas in the race I got water
For niggas with hate I got llamas
Tissues for they mama
I'm flyer than Aladdin on a carpet
Saw A Whole New World when I made my profits
And my jasmine is a rapping
I do it the best, These niggas ain't smashing
Raw dog action
I impregenate the beat everytime I speak
A seed of my speech concives and MC! 
Similar to me,so we ain't' got to write just think
Keep it in the head like T
Spit listerine on the beat
Flossin' diamonds and me
Now peep the way I deliver on the beat
Is what you lack yeah that's why I'm so SWEET!
That's why yo chick want to pump me 
She want to be the chick from the other guy
Wanna be a lover I chuckle I laugh
As soon as you turn yo back I'm smashing
Hey I'm the other guy
Now you wanna rumble why
I mixed some limbs up make you a jambalaya
Wet you up
Roll you down the mountain and let your tumble drop
Throwback line for those who been listening 
For all the new listeners that boy just filling
Niceklus is gifted nickename his Christmas
Make up a wishlish
Cop yall CD at this point I bet yall get it
At this point forget it..
I'm like a preganat woman I deliver
Now pop it push it!
We in hoodies and timbs
Out on the grind
Rain or shine
Nickels and dimes
I'm out tryna to get his paper
That's why I roll up and tend to get high
Cause my arms won't extend to the sky
Peer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes
So I can only grab my pen and advise
Street legends and chicks seem to wonder
Exactly who I am
You know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup
It's Drake and Saint Nick
Take a whiff of this and faint quick
Off a sample of the flow patient
But I don't lie to rhymers
I strip walls and apply the primer
If there's a wall I'm gon' try to climb-aaa
Without a graded rope
Our navy seal Buddies yelling slurs at me
I'm always gon find another way to go
I'm minty fresh with the Green like I'm made a bathing scope
No bathing ape but I'm clean Like I'm made of soap
Begging for the fire
Buglars in hear we
We all good in the fam we like Meagan and limiya
I dress like Lou, I sell verses to label
And they give me the next joint
To sound less like you
That's something I had to say before
I'm real picky with real with lyrics
So don't use joints you probably would pay me for
I ain't' a heat busser
What up to Denik Rusha and Bei Major, Trey Songz, the street's Usher
Leak tracks and heat wax and he bust ya
And then sign ya
This is a reminder
This along the lines of Thrill is Gone still the song
I'mma mention Jay even though I feel it's wrong
We gave good ambition homegirl couldn't listen
Now she want the Snackpack back and her pudding's missin'
Bring the topic back
Please don't stop the track
Tropicana never got the hammer by my jock in-fact, I keep my money there
Mixtapes where I top em at
DJ Smallz.com you can shop at that
Speak of shopping I'm tryna get a label deal
Tryna live my dreams while awake, tryna make the fables real
No stealing cable trying to have my cable still
Better yet stolen, my grammar is golden
My grammer go harder than most rappers
There's a certain female rapper I will expose and
For once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing
No I didn't pen that Freestyle shit
I got a session with Digs so the beef I'm gone end that
Anybody else get the piece that I bend back
Let it marinate if you niggas dare to hateLook, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause
I'm from the city where people be gettin' lazy
Litterin' in the streets
And the club district is poppin' like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers
Money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams
And dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events
Bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot
So girls'll give up the ass
And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like Snoopy and Woodstock
Daffy and Bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane
And she back where she was
Right back on the bus
It's a shame cause now at his window
She throwin' bricks like Shaq in the clutch
You can see that's shes colder
'Cause he doesn't hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her
That he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say
Now up north there's five artists deservin' a listen
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through
Chances are that it ain't you
I single-handedly carry out what you can't do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple that's eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in & the out and the plan's seeming ill
Whenever I'm out in Memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm Andreena mill
Japan and Brazil, the audience screaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend

Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'

My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!

But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you’re clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It’s like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got ‘em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
And a pen for any beef trying to approach us
Let the sucker burn, I don’t even flip 'em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain’t seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, I'm hot as hell and I don’t even need a stylist
Spit the infernal like the Real World Challenge
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You’re running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis

Rae Sremmurd, Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi - What’s In Your Heart? I don't fuck with niggas like a redneck
Catch an opp slippin', flip his wig like a Tech Deck
This funk shit, I bring it to your door like Fed Ex
And talkin' dumb'll get your ass popped like a Xanax
Big forty, that'll knock a nigga soul out him
If I'm on my ass then for sure I know my bros got me
Knock a nigga down, if they ask, I don't know 'bout it
These Balenciagas, lil nigga these ain't Foamposites
Fifty on the chop, yeah I gave that bitch a tune-up
You better keep your boo tucked before you get your boo fucked
Slide on an opp and give one fuck, two fucks
Glock twenty-three, clip hangin' like two nuts
And we bust first, nigga we don't bust back
Tone with the shred will lay you down like where them bucks at?
Four shots to the dome, two where his lungs at
Forty hold ten? What the fuck, where that drum at?
Hatin' on you bum hoes like Cascade
You broke niggas young money like Mack Maine
Rich shit, Gucci box for the ashtray
My shooter keep a stick and with the shit like his ass stank
Get around they bros, niggas want to act tough now
See me gettin' cheese and these bitches wanna fuck now
Arm start crampin', niggas had to put the pump down
Size ten Timb boot, niggas gettin' stomped out bitch
White buffs on, bitch these Cartiers
All these bands a nigga get, I wouldn't call it fair
Stay out my closet, lil nigga might get lost in there
And this chopper turn your whip into a rocking chair
Young nigga with these bands, got the streets talkin'
Diamonds on my neck dancin', C walkin'
Chopper make a nigga bounce, call that leap froggin'
Bitch I'm a dog and to these hoes I'ma keep doggin'
And she know I'm on, let my niggas bone, yeah yeah
I would never cuff at all, we could never fuck with y'all, yeah yeah
Bitch I got the juice like Hi-C
Dark tints on my face, don't eye me
She give all head like an ID
Beat a nigga ass like I'm Ali
I don't fuck with these niggas, you know that
Slimmy got that chop, he gon' blow that
Wish a nigga would, bet he won't
Like a bad bitch with must, niggas don't want the funk
Send ten shots through a nigga whip like a car lot
One shot, hit a nigga chest, make his heart stop
Hate a used bitch like a whip from a car lot
Don't trust these niggas that'll turn like a doorknob
Got money on my mind now, a nigga don't waste time baby
I'ma get it out the way
I know these niggas ain't tough, I done really had enough
Shoeboxes I don't fuck with the bank, nah nigga
I'll never hesitate, I'll never turn fake
I'll never shake a fuck nigga's hand, I'll never, I'll never
Say she wanna boss nigga I'll never
Fuck with a broke bitch that ain't got no cheddar
I could never be you, everything's with a tool
These Margiela my shoes, that's a GLE coupe
Yes I bust down my jewels, almost flunked out of school
What's engraved on my dash, ain't no way I'ma lose
All eight up in the Fanta, what the fuck is a deuce?
We with all eye busters, I Am Mr. Mosley 2
Don't test the gang right now, we ain't got nothin' to lose
Why these nigga always tellin'? Why you lyin' about a felony?
Know these niggas all jokesters, know they friends with Bill Bellamy
I'm all about my green, broccoli, and my celery
They hate how I do this, I'm a nuisance, the Ruler
Passin' cash out, I'm Mr. Big Bank Budda
Uchie uchie, you know I get those
Bald head Caillou's fallin' all on my denim
In the county you get pulled like a wisdom tooth, it's the truth
The violence that'll get at you, my guidance what I spill at you, ughMe and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
'Cause mine's it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you
You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You work it off 
Baby I can give you extra credit 
But there's something else
Girl, can I frisk you?
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
It's 'cause you're hidin' WMD's
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby, you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it mine?
Can I love you all my life?KD, I know you're here, I know you understand me
Real talent doesn't always win championships
Like real music doesn't always win Grammy's
But we're okay...
Honorable mention works for me and you
Honorable mention, hey, hey
You're lucky that LeBron finally had to lose
He gets an honorable mention, hey
It ain't so bad being number two
Yeah, season's over, just hold on you're going home
Can't deal with life's hurdles like you're Lolo Jones
Series over, feel the sorrow, drink it down
Bartender I think I'll have a Triple Crown
And I'm the only one, I think I'll be the only one
You ready
Iggy Azalea and Swaggy P
I love you both, you're like a poor man's Jay and Bey
You know what I'm saying?
Collin Kaepernick you know I love to see you flexing
It's just a damn shame that Michael Crabtree can't catch it
Danica you don't always come in first place we know
But somehow in Nascar you're the only face we know
Honorable mention
Honorable mention
Didn't win didn't lose
Just got a honor mention
And now the whole the whole U.S of A are soccer fans too
They get an honorable mention
But even in Brazil inspirational dreams don't always
Come trueI'm back, baby, where the love?
Ayy, yeah
Ayy, ayy 
Writin' this from Florida with love 
Rest in peace to Static, yellin' "Shawty want a thug," ayy
Bottles in the club, ayy, know I love to touch 
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
Bottles in the club, ayy, know I love to touch 
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus 
Went and got a chain for me, I had to give it up 
Niggas had they pistols loaded pointed at my truck, ayy
And you know that lesson stuck 
From that day I never touched the road without a 
Ayy, from that day I never saw the point in talkin' tough 
Hasn't happened since, I guess you niggas know what's up 
Yeah, haven't seen the 6ix in like a month 
Fuck that, I'm back, baby, where the love? 
Rappers that I threw an alley-oop are throwin' subs 
But they gotta dap me when they see me, that's what's up 
I let that shit slide, I got everything
I can lose it all if I'm reactin' to the petty things
My bro named Casino, yeah, but he ain't into bettin' things
FBG the gang and they down to stain anything, mhm
Yeah, that's right 
FBG the gang and they down to stain anything 
Mhm , yeah, that's right 
FBG the gang and they…
Booted up, turned up, piped up

I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love?
Booted up, turned up, piped up 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love? 
I'm back, baby, where the love?Oh-oh-oh-oh

You've got some vacation time
You and your girlfriend too badmind
Bad, bad, bad, when you're both combined
I don't get how you look so nice
Girl, you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude 
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to you
I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
I need to hold the corner  and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
You a real bad gyal weh nuh tek back chat
And anything yuh say yuh can defend that
You a real bad gyal weh nuh tek back chat
And anything yuh say yuh can defend that too
Right now we're just taking time
Other things are on your mind
And you want bad, bad, bad when I treat you right
I don't care how you look so nice
Girl, you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude 
Look what you're putting me through

I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
I need to hold the corner  and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
'Cause, girl, you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude 
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to youIt's 10 O'clock on a Wednesday and I know your home
Drivin up and down your street
Hopin that you'll come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me
Childish as it seems, it'll make it all better, better
Selfish as it is, this just ain't about you no
Did me wrong every time we were together, -gether
And that's why
I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could've made it all on my ownSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected
People just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
They just wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
Chorus: 
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..

What we doing Drake? 
Take your whole bag of candy, leave you in the cold
So bring the ruckus if you under 12 years old
It's 7:58 and now your curfew is pushin
Watch how just like Republicans I'm behind the bushes
"It wasn't me" - if you asked me, that's what I'mma tell ya
And I'mma eat so much chocolate, my blood type's Nutella
Got wanted signs from madd parents, state troopers
Kidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch-slapped an Oompa-Loompa
Give me your Reese's Pieces, give me your Hershey bars
I want your Milky Way, give me that Snickers bar
I would Trick-or-Treat but I'm too old now
So I snatch your bag so I don't look like a pedophile
My sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me
We're talking stomach aches, restraining orders, cavities
I probably won't have no teeth when I'm finished
I don't pay for the porcelains, I just marry my dentistWho else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G though
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Baby girl on that Mclaren
You gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could
You know what it is, Drake and Tim Westwood"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 1
You say it's simple, it's who you ought to be
Look in the mirror, you are not what you see
You say it's simple, but aren't your wings tired?
To tell the truth, why do you have to hide?
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
They telling me lies
What's wrong with being someone else?
No shame, and living life their way, tell me lies
They like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
It's like
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 2
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
And now they like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
Cause the fabrication would help to settle that
And imagination would ease the pain
I came into this world as honest and pure
But can't guarantee to you that I'mma leave the same, so
]
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now, tell me lies
I said, tell me liesHo, yeah, uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me 
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the gameYeah, look
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please
I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, ain't nothin' much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin'
D boys jugglin', single mother strugglin'
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbor's house, I'm on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
But both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
My left arm's like David Wells
My right arm's like Holliday, so I'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
For just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to pleaseCheck 
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
I write so, I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ISO
What is about to unfold, no tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though, I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw, that is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my  
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
It's been a couple weeks out travelin' and this broad
I've seen a couple freaks out battlin' for discharge it's odd
I try to tell her I ain't seen a flier one
Denying some, I have desired some, but that time is done
Now I am gon' give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, I've embraced one in lace, she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I mean literal
Her girl made it figurative, or maybe that's what liquor do
Baby, that's the physical, maybe if we spend
A few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin' hittin' on the road is the typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin' through
Your pictures, this bruh took a good game
But a fella couldn't Roc, I wanna Dash to my Dame
I'm sayin', I know I be playin' too much
But I'd rather go deaf than loose touch, holla at me
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my  
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
Round, round, round, round, round
Ayo, the same chick from "Don't you have a man?" "Well..."
It all blowed over like Manuel Noriega
She said she wouldn't marry the player
But she's the Tamia to his Grant Hill, man chill
I thought you was my damn seal
In distress, rescue you from the landfill
She said, "That ain't enough protection
I need +Affection+ like Lisa Stansfield
I guess I can't be mad at this thing that you got
I'll lace you up but I ain't tryin' to tie the knot, so ah
From me you won't hear no more questions
And please understand that you got my blessings
I hope that your new love opens doors
And is everything that you hopin' for
But you can't get my new shit, girl you spoken for
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my  
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like "I ain't getting service in your area"
You be like "Nigga get your bars up"
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong, I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch, holla at me baby! 
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my  
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be aroundNigga stop playin', I just left Hsu Yun
I don't rap beef, I just know TECs and drums
And you ain't do it right if no detectives come
And I brought kate into the booth, ain't got no extra tie
You can say my wrist broke but my neck is fire
Flu flamm the rap game 'til I get extradited
Judging by my case files I'm obsessed with rifles
Had a meeting with the floggers just to say I'm they idol
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict 
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bally 
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you 
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bally 
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you
Don't at me
Fuck it, please bro at me
They gon' have to find a suitable picture for Fox 11
You ain't learn from Cold Devil, I'm a nuisance, I'm tellin' you
Take a mud walk through Neimans like I got expensive power
I got dirty money on me but I just got out the shower
I'll shoot up everything, we ain't squabbling for hours
I can tell that nigga sour, plug talkin' with alfalfa
Know my attitude is childish, if I spoke to you be honored
I'm a flu flammer nigga, two pumps when I enter
Tryna break a Kylie Jenner, bitch I'm Drakeo, I'm a winner
Niggas in the Twitter fingers, if I shoot you there's no ending
The flashing lights on my pendant, I'm a legend out of prison
I'm a front door kicker, Liu Kang was my mentor
Off a five and a perc, two thirty was the printin'
Out of school from suspension, not because it was dismissal
And let my dick go nigga, bro I know you niggas miss me
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict 
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bally 
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you 
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bally 
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you
I got extradited twice, stuck in Texas three times
Bitch, I really used to chase the seconds in my free time
Claim they ain't have enough, so hard, I have to serve it three times
Bitch, I'm 03, so I'm watchin' out for one time
I can turn a hater to a motherfuckin' punchline
Now and Later gators with a motherfuckin' Glock 9
I bought some designer and some weapons so I won't die
All we make is slappers, treat a rapper like a horsefly
Ride the wave, this ain't a boat ride
Janky got the stick and Lil Kitty got the four-five
Locked tools, strapped up, and them niggas gon' try
Watch out for the G-Hive
I'm from the side where we G slide 
I need blue hundreds, no green guy 
I'm off the mud and the trees like
We out the slums, fresh out the slums
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict 
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bally 
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash you 
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealing with some things, you perceive it's post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posing for Bally 
I don't rap beef, if it's on I'ma crash youSide pieces
I know that you're watching this from home
I can't wait to see you on the road
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out
Wifey sees a text and asks what's this all about
I tell her you're just a friend
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end
I'm asking would you be mine
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you
This goes out to all my side pieces
Side pieces, side pieces
This goes out to all my side pieces
You know that you'll never be the main one
City to city I see you we're in the same one
Side pieces, side
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise for the real king of side pieces Brian McKnight one time
This is dedicated to all of the side pieces
I know you'll never be more
And you'll always be less
But there's comfort in knowing that you're okay being second best
I already got a starter but I'm looking for the rest of my team
Side pieces in training go on and wave your hands for Drake and me

When the world it gets so crowded
That you can't look out the window in the morning?
And what will happen in the evening
In the forest with the weasel
With the teeth that bite so sharp
When you're not looking in the evening?
And all the friends that you once knew are left behind
They kept you safe and so secure
Amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime
What will happen, in the morning
When the world it gets so crowded
That you can't look out the window in the morning?
Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
Now, take a little while to make your sister fair
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eyeshade
Start over again
Now, take a little while to find your way in here
Now, take a little while to make your story clear
Now that you're lifting your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor and never look 'round
Let's sing a song for Hazey Jane
She's back again, in my mind
If songs were lines in a conversation
The situation would be fineHigh rollers what's up
Dreams Houston what's up
Onyx what’s up
You does it baby you does it baby
Harlem Knights what’s up
Treasures what’s up
Legends what’s up
Just love me baby just love me baby
Yeeeeeah
To all my Houston Texas country muffins
Baby let me hit that liquor and that blunt you puffin
And after that I’mma throw that fucking young money up
And we can both watch and fall like it’s bungee jumping
Man I’m so high, next time we won't smoke all of that ounce you buy
Oooh, I almost forgot to blow them candles out
Cause I don’t really want to fall asleep and light this house on fire
Goodnight, I’m still up, I told my girl to lay down
I see the bottle is full, I’m bout to drink it way down
What up Bun my nigga
Man you know we stay down
And I’m an honoray resident in UGK town
I’m on my way
Yeah Im on my way
I never give a fuck about what any nigga say
The music all slow and the bitches all pretty
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city in this thing
What up, what up
H Town in this bitch
What up, what up
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
What up, what up
What up, what up
Money by the Ton
Bricks from Crumbs
Millionnaire from nothing
Mind on hustlin
Pussy’s a commodity but dick sell better
Em dickies and high shoes to a cashmere sweater
Paint that got wetter than it was in 94
The drink that got thicker and the dirt weed rolled
96 Impala with the stick on the floor
Now its Bentely Four Doors with Patron on the Doors
Light wood nigga Polo fuck Hilfiger
Jammin Slim Thug, Belly fully of drugs
Young hard nigga, underdog nigga
Yellow Lights on the Masa 
Yellow diamonds on my finger

What up, what up
H Town in this bitch
What up, what up
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
What up, what up
What up, what up
Well its the Trill OG
I got the neighbourhood soul
Kush is dead Im getting blowed
Riding bangin getting throwed in the candy painted low
Chrome grill in front of it
Belts on the back of it, my homie shoes running it
And shorty on the side of me is straight up off the king cover
Don’t care what anybody say long as the King love her
Wish I could tell her that I dont but it would kill her
I just keep on gripping grains dripping stains
Being trilla ain't another brother realer
Blowing thousand dollar killer
With the Filipino flow that I just got it from Manila
Bout to snow up in my city
So let me put on my chincilla
In the ‘rari doing donuts like my name was J Dilla
All about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer
Keep the work up in the attic and the money in the cellar
Your girl up in the second automatics for the fella’s
You see us in the back than all you gotta do is tell us
What up, what up
H Town in this bitch
What up, what up
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
What up, what up
What up, what upLets go
Well alright, well alright
Look
Uh
Feeling sorry for the runner up
I’m still awake, getting money while the sun is up
And they keep saying how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie star doesn’t put the numbers up
Man, hate is so passé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and it’s just me and my money
Ya don’t even get to play when ya’ll leading by 20
Yeah I infiltrated the game
I was hesitant at first and fear what it would change
Now I’m high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still managed to keep all of my opinions the same
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit
Shout out to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah from the beginning to the end
Know I’m into making history not into making friends
Muthafuckaaaa…When the day is done
Down to earth, then, sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done
When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you began
When the day is done
When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold
When the bird has flown
Got no one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown
When the game's been fought
Newspaper blown across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought
When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through
When the day is done
Down to earth, then, sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is doneAlright well, um, alright. We... we'll fuckin' figure it out. You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it, you know, makin' it to the top. All the way to the top. Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'?
Part of me wish that I could meet with all you haters in person
They got a lot of feelings for me they just ain't certain
How to express themself when I walk into the club
And take stares like the fuckin elevators ain't workin
Yea
Cuz they know the promoter paid you
You wouldn’t have come if someone hadn’t of made you
You just lookin forward to seein woman that played you
And shittin on the men they get engaged to
I swear it’s like
Uh
More confidence and less fear
We can discuss it further when yall manage to get here
Diddy here, o here, skinny here, rex here
And we just havin one of those conversations about next year
Ima kill it I promise this I know you mad
Ive always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much all I want is the
Yeah, I want the money , money and the cars
Cars and the clothes , the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be , I just wanna be successful 
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Yeah
And I don't know if I can do that with you, so...Strange face, with your eyes so pale and sincere
Underneath you know well you have nothing to fear
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life where Spring is sprung
Mmm
You would seem so frail in the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion go out to fight
But while the Earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky on the crest of a wave
So forget this cruel world where I belong
I'll just sit and wait and sing my song
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me to your place in the cloud
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
MmmYeah
J–j–j–just in my zone, I close my figures up
All your hoes chose me, nigga, calm down 
Louis pouch across my body, this is not for fashion
This is not a playground – ain't no fist fight, bitch, I'm blastin'
Niggas say they lookin' for me like I'm not right here, man
If I tatted tears, I'd be cryin' to my beard, man
Bitch, I'm tryna fuck, I've been inside for thirteen years now
I've been on so many flights, it's like my record's clear now
A.k.a. the man, a.k.a. I never ran
Don't make me turn this red light on your head like you Roxanne
Only talk to bosses, not the second-in-command
Niggas bringin' talks to me, you better have a plan
'Cause they don't have a cure for all my pain
A.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my name
Yah, yah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim
A.k.a it's Not Nice and it's not a fuckin' game
Gyah, gyah! You and I, we're not the same
Posted like Ibaka, got your wifey runnin' brains
She was there with boydem, kicked my front door off the frame
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Trap, trap, trappin' in the rain
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Just know I'm a shooter first and rap is not my thing
A.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my—
Hidin' in the racks
I don't pay tax, twelve on my back
Might drive the Caddy around but I never lack
Baka not with the shit? So yeah, who tellin' you that?
I went to jail the day they released Men in Black
When I came out, Timberlake was bringin' Sexy Back
Facts, nigga! Facts!
I fell in love with my strap
Named my son Milli 'cause I want a milli' to stack
Gyah, gyah! Go run and tell that
You niggas move like the cops, don't make me pepper your block
Out the window while the whip's movin', that's a hell of a shot
Fuck all my opps, I'll put you niggas on FOX
Gyah, gyah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim

It's Southern Smoke baby!
 Frank Dukes
 My man Nickelus F
 Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
 This is the remix right here
 So if you got some 
Put ya hands in the air
 Southern Smoke
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
 Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!
I, take time arrange that 
Some, kill just to claim that 
Switch countries exchange that 
You cannot get jack for freeee
And my, proceeds and cash right 
There's, no need to stash right 
Got the same, four G's from last night 
You cannot take that from me, homie
Money’s the reason my best friend got murdered
So with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it
Milk the game, turn it to butter, look how I turned it
No chick shall get any of dis unless she earns it
Take that dick, put to your lips and insert it
Where the hell is self-respect go when them checks show?
You sleep with them anywhere, hell is your bed for?
You always on your back, what the hell is your legs for?
I know, walk that strip, get my grip
That new Benz’s comin out, put some 'umph' in your switch, trick
Plus I need rims, diamonds and gems
So get up, do the hand job, and some head for him
I got my mind on my money, and my money on your mind
I’ll blow your mind all over the money that’s on your mind
So keep my dough off your head, fuck with do on your head
Now you really got money on your mind, nigga!This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe
If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy
It's crazy, I can't help it if you feelin' change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change
Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something babyOliver Mix

You want that feeling back?
Probably one of my realest loves ever
Four page letters, and time is all better

I’d rather stay friend with benefits till we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like “one more chance”, more problems no biggie ah
It’s all good don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give eachother space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that

Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long

You know how it be when I’m rolling in the sheets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Genuine, ’cause I’m the same O G

Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies
Arguing in Barney’s, fly shit, too much pride to say sorry

Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again 
Soon as you get in
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
Planned this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone, so they'll never know
But I might tell you one day, you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel and don't worry 'bout doing your hair
Or what you should wear, this not a video shoot, I don't care
Don't over prepare
Gotta remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way, but just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you, j-just be ready to go
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with youUh, I am a distraction
Comin from my spot and I dont signal as I back in
If cash is beautiful, then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin’ centerfold of Maxim
Open to my page and admire my desire
Frequent flyer, I aspire to retire
My voice stands alone even if I’m with the choir
Got a cannon on my hip, but nigga, this is not Mariah
Na, this the record killer for hire
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require
Look I created, despite the niggas that hated
Every single bar gettin' first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin' so sedated
The me and bitch the same, we feel so related
Forest Hill estated, all dinners catered
I put a thousand on it, I could probably fuck the waitress
So, wait, just take this
Oone lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit
Drop a four in it and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga
I wrote this verse sittin' in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
It’s more about where you are
And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be
Somebody, somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how we're all ending up
I’m at the label in the elevator, send 'em up!Okay I just got back from another label meeting and
I ain't what they looking for I ain't what they looking for
I ain't really Atlanta I ain't really Brooklyn or
I dont fit the appeal for them shows that they could book him for
Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall
I'm famous so I get approached fast, Louie and Coach bags
All up in coach class, gem like Topaz, cool like slow Jazz
Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass
I promise this is me, me
I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you
You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you
Yea
Ok, I'm floating in my zone without a scheduled descend
The rising and the fall was never my intent
I want this shit forever printed in cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
I'm only tryin to win I ain't tryna present
You gotta listen close like it's coming through the vent
These rappers can't see me I live behind the tint
And just to get a visual them niggas gotta squint
There I ammmm
Little me in row 23F real reconize real is there none of yall left?
Everybody in the game can't none of yall ref?
And filter out the bullshit the fuck is yall def?
You'r now tuned in to the new comer of this summer
The Chris Paul of this fall exist yall - Yea
And is the realist nigga still I?!
A bitch could love you to death and you still die
Ahhh!
I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit is wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Just keep it between me and you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Yea
Whats goin on yall?
I wanna thank yall for coming out tonight
I go by the name of Drake
I got my man Slakah The Beatchild here
My man Hazel
You already know we about to rock tonight

Jeremy flies
Hoping to keep
The sun from his eyes
East from the city
And down to the cave
In search of a master
In search of a slave
Three hours from London
Giacomo's free
Taking his woes
Down to the sea
In search of a lifetime
To tell when he's home
In search of a story
That's never been known
Three hours from speaking
Everyone's flown
Not wanting to be
Seen on their own
Three hours is needed
To leave from them all
Three hours to wonder
And three hours to fall
Three hours from sundown
Jeremy flies
Hoping to keep
The sun from his eyes
East from the city
And down to the cave
In search of a master
In search of a slaveOliver Set

It was, uh... it was alright. Shit's just crazy man. The whole energy out here is just changing, you know, it's just getting dark man, quick. It's like mans are on the road it feels like as if anybody is a target, you know, you just don't know where it's gonna come from, can't even gauge it man. It's like I go from that, trying to balance that to just balance my own sanity, drinking more, smoking more, you know staying up so late that it's early, like fuck. I'm not losing it though, you know, I'm just venting, I'm not like worried, it's already too late for these guys trust me, I'm just more worried about myself you know, I just gotta come home.
JUNGLE
??: What's the day today?
??: October 2nd, 2008
??: I'mma take the same video, on October 2nd 2009 and see if we can get in this thing without ID Fuck the D.A., free the Ruler 
Sex cancelled, I went right for that medulla
Talkin' spicy hella easy, niggas hide behind computers
Talkin' 'bout some he gon' fight me, it's unlikely, he a tulip
Hoes askin' if I'm booted, take a hike
I said I might be in these Ksubis, I might just make a movie
Like I'm Mikey Alfred, she know that I'm a Pisces
I be swimmin' through the coochie and I'm like what about it?
I'm out here, blue strips by the thousands 
We count it , then re-count it
Loose lips sink ships, I ain't drown yet
Don't know what niggas askin', they hustlin' backwards
Tell the same tall tale that you tucked and you ran with
If it's up, then it's stuck somewhere in the rafters
I'm up, I'm a factor, sharp like X-ACTO
Promised mama I won't rap beef with no actors
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict 
Dealin' with some things you'd perceive as post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posin' for Bally
I don't rap beef, if it's on, I'ma crash you 
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealin' with some things you'd perceive as post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posin' for Bally 
I don't rap beef, if it's on, I'ma crash you
Don't at me
Fuck it, please, bro, at me
They gon' have to find a suitable picture for Fox 11
You ain't learn from Cold Devil, I'm a nuisance, I'm tellin' you
Take a mud walk through Neimans like I got a special power
I got dirty money on me, but I just got out the shower
I'll shoot up everything, we ain't squabblin' for hours
I can tell that nigga sour, plug talkin' with Alfalfa
Know my attitude is childish, if I spoke to you, be honored
I'm a flu flammer, nigga, two pumps when I enter
Tryna break a Kylie Jenner, bitch, I'm Drakeo, I'm a winner
Niggas in they Twitter fingers, if I shoot you, there's no endin'
Flashin' lights on my pendant, I'm a legend out of prison
I'm a front-door kicker, Liu Kang was my mentor
Off a five and a Perc', two thirty was the printin'
Out of school from suspension, not because it was dismissal
Let my dick go, nigga, bro, I know you niggas miss me, ugh
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict 
Dealin' with some things you'd perceive as post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posin' for Bally
I don't rap beef, if it's on, I'ma crash you 
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealin' with some things you'd perceive as post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posin' for Bally 
I don't rap beef, if it's on, I'ma crash you 
I got extradited twice, stuck in Texas three times
Bitch, I really used to chase the seconds in my free time
Claim they ain't have enough, so hard, I have to serve it three times
Bitch, I'm 03, so I'm watchin' out for one time
I can turn a hater to a motherfuckin' punchline
Now and Later gators with a motherfuckin' Glock 9
I bought some designer and some weapons so I won't die
All we make is slappers, treat a rapper like a horsefly
Ride the wave, this ain't a boat ride
Janky got the stick and Lil Kitty got the four-five
Locked tools, strapped up, and them niggas gon' try
Watch out for the G-Hive
I'm from the side where we G slide 
I need blue hundreds, no green guy 
I'm off the mud and the trees like
We out the slums, fresh out the slums
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict 
Dealin' with some things you'd perceive as post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posin' for Bally
I don't rap beef, if it's on, I'ma crash you 
All mud in the freezer, niggas sayin' I'm an addict
Dealin' with some things you'd perceive as post-traumatic 
I'm a road runner, should be posin' for Bally 
I don't rap beef, if it's on, I'ma crash youDamn, another 20 missed calls
I love her and I hate her
It's a funny twist y'all
Can't stand her it when she in town
But miss her when she gone
Truth be told
I'd rather be with her than alone
But fights break out
And neighbors call 5-0
Screamin you the most foul bitch I know!
Forever mine wherever I go
Sex pistols out  die slow
Nah die slower than that
Just co-llapse all over my matt-ressss
Who shot cha that nigga ain't finished
So once again I find myself in it 
Just let me take a minute
Round 2 is in the chamber
All you gotta do is spin it
Aim for the heart
Battle of the sexes
All's fair love and war casualties expectedSaturday sun came early one morning
In a sky so clear and blue
Saturday sun came without warning
So no-one knew what to do
Saturday sun brought people and faces
That didn’t seem much in their day
But when I remembered those people and places
They were really too good in their way
In their way
In their way
Saturday sun won’t come and see me today
Think about stories with reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people in their season and time
Returning again and again
And again
And again
But Saturday’s sun has turned to Sunday’s rain
So Sunday sat in the Saturday sun
And wept for a day gone by]
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world
Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the worldUchies, uchies
Uchies, uchies, uchies
Uchies, uchies
Try me? please, you don't have enough uchies
Let alone enough groupies, I'm ridin' with the broskis
Tell me how you wanna do it, killers ride to my music
On God I can't think straight, a buck fifty on the E-way
They ain't never finna get me, they ain't never finna get me
But they can get a high speed chase
Anything for the uchies, tryna tell you I'm the Ruler
Heads down when you speak to me
Get on your knees when you greet me
You know I got it in me, and nigga your attitude 
Don't like pops in my business, too many pops from the beginning
I'm riding with a sentence
I'm all about the uchies, tired of bump-ins with new
They be acting like they won't
Ten bands for a lawyer, that was just for him to speak to me
Niggas wanna write grievances
'Cause they hating on my knots, why they hating on my knots?
'Cause they hugging on the block, I tried to tell you I'm a problem
Uchies uchies, uchies, uchies uchies
Uchies uchies, uchies, uchies uchies
Anything for the uchies, anything for the uchies
Anything, anything, anything for the uchies
Anything for the uchies
Anything, anything, anything for the uchies
Midnight mission, on my bullshit
Looking for some money and a cool bitch
Still getting money off of "Youzza Flip"
You looking like a bum, like a hipster bitch
You bummies, other people's money
12 years old got beat up for serving dummies
I love the uchi, goddamn I love the money
My play auntie, was my favorite smoker
Taught me how to cook up, shake, and play poker
Let me hustle out her car to go to Oakland
Go stupid, got hyphy with the hustle
And I yatted out this gat
I used to sell my lunch tickets, and hit the dice game, ooh
Drakeo, that's Mr. Get Dough
Jay 305, Mr. Mr. Good Dough
Uchies uchies, uchies, uchies uchies uchies
Uchies uchies, uchies, uchies uchies
Anything for the uchies, anything for the uchies
Anything, anything, anything for the uchies
Anything for the uchies
Anything, anything, anything for the uchies
Mr. Uchies, cold devil, it's life threatening
Chop a nigga down for these pints, it's my medicine
If I don't chilly, bye bye bitch you ain't getting nada
Keep the bloodiest bottle 'cause I ain't never wore Prada
Bleed 'em, fuck it, these niggas I never need 'em
Riding in the Boondocks, we dodgin' the Stinc nina
Bleed teamer, ain't fucking him, ain't fucking me neither
A fake watch, a fake chain, on me there's neither
The Stinc Teamer, this nigga's a meat beater
Silly billy, call shirley nigga 'cause we leaving
Twenty strips on the floor for any nigga competing
Jesus, somebody call a deacon
Threw so much money, shit the altar need a cleaning
I should get a beating, all this money I'm receiving
Threw so much money, shit the altar need a cleaning
Cause bitch I'm getting uchies, believe it

Young Jeezy - Bottom Of The MapWell, hello, let's go
Everybody must know
Love's in my heart like a bomb
It's blowing a song
Inside I'm singing
Sunshine that your bringing now
And it makes me happy
Listen to the radio
Playing back in stereo
Sounds like my favorite song
I'm humming along
My head is ringing
And I just can't stop singing now
'Cause it makes me happy
You're everything I need
Handed from above
I can't get enough of your love
Cause it makes me happy
Living in a day-dream
I'll show you what it all means
Spending some time in the sun
Let's get up and run
It's just beginning
And I just can't stop singing now
Cause it makes me happy
Like a fantasy
That you never find
Right in front of me
All the time
And it makes me happy
I want it all but not too much
I wanna feel the way you touch me
I'm the kind of guy who's always there to come and find you
Save the raining days for another time
I'm just here to say read between the lines
I'm so glad that your mine
Cause you make me happy
You make me wanna sing

But I'm too busy finding pour, just picture me mud walkin'
I know you want me by my lonely
Not even fuckin' with the homies, I'm too busy mud walkin'
Just know I'm never by my lonely

I be wildin' when I'm pourin'
I pray to God they free the homies 'cause they could be mud walkin'
I got the pocket rocket on me
Long stocking in a forty, promoters at clubs' problems
I sent the purple dick emoji
But then I curve her, do I know you? just look at me mud walkin'
Niggas actin' like they want me
Can't even afford a Rollie, let alone mud prices
I got Pablo with some orange
But I won't have 'em know I want to text him some court trials
Let 'em know, I'm aggravated and I'm poured
I know I'm always on the road but picture me mud walkin'
I know that pussy might be golden
But I'm too busy finding pour, just picture me mud walkin'
I know you want me by my lonely
Not even fuckin' with the homies, I'm too busy mud walkin'
Just know I'm never by my lonely

I feel real good right about now
I feel like im, im making a return
I ain't even been gone yet I ain't even
Taken a leave of absence but I feel like I'm back
Yeah man
Check, I roll with the coalition, when no one listened
I spoke out now niggas is throwing this in
You gassed up, my vehicle low emission
I can enter your field trip with no permission
Slip, i've done it before told ya I run it before
Now the city is mine, and what you thought it would be
Ain't a rapper working harder than me I put my heart in T
Uh, ?, carry the city on my back like a Jansport
Or even in a victor bag, so if you quick to brag then u get clipped to tag
Homie, u make a lot of music niggas ain't feeling
You rappers shouldn't rap, you rappers should paint ceilings
That's why I ain't competitive y'all, cuz deep down I know im much better than y'all
Watchu mean do I actually flow, wanna know if I actually flow just ask V-O
Im tryna make the wrist on my cousin ashley glow till she waken up by someone and it actually snow
Stop snitching if your man seen a killer, you never ever seen it, it can't seem familiar
We keep it on and poppin like the dance scene in Thriller
This the new version fresh prince and andreana miller
And d-10tion the boi-1da
And people focused on keeping the boy under
Probably cuz I don't act like y'all
And I ain't gotta sell crack like y'all
Well not really, I mean I do move crack in a disc form
But thats only because I don't rap like y'all
And now its occurring to them
Its starting to be my friend is reassuring to them
Either that or every verse im referring to them
So catch me in a zone till they leave me alone
Uh, yea, and its down south for the summer ima leave them at home
Uh, and thats just what it is
Uh, everybody that mess with me I see you
You feel me
Benard I see ya homie
Precise I see ya
Ransom, brandon I see ya
Uh, niko I see ya uh
Yea richie sosa I see ya uh
Yea JD Era I see ya
Mayhem maury er I see ya
Yea that's the coalition
D-10tion boi-1da the commitment
Heartfelt music
Andreana I see you baby
Sox yea, row
You know
Uh, we keep it goin, there's no stopping it
Its my year its my summer my decade
Yea you got an entry flow, you gotta stick around for the whole century flow nigga
That's how I do it holla at me
And thats itFame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish
‘til its stock is in the ground
So men of fame
Can never find a way
‘til time has flown
Far from their dying day
Forgotten while you’re here
Remembered for a while
A much updated ruin
From a much outdated style
Life is but a memory
Happened long ago
Theatre full of sadness
For a long forgotten show
Seems so easy
Just to let it go on by
‘til  you stop and wonder
Why you never wondered why
Safe in the womb
Of an everlasting night
You'll find the darkness can
Give the brightest light
Safe in your place deep in the earth
That’s when they’ll know what you were really worth
Forgotten while you’re here
Remembered for a while
A much updated ruin
From a much outdated style
Fame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish
‘til its stock is in the ground
So men of fame
Can never find a way
‘til time has flown
Far from their dying day
Fruit tree, fruit tree
No-one knows you but the rain and the air
Don’t you worry
They’ll stand and stare when you’re gone
Fruit tree, fruit tree
Open your eyes to another year
They’ll all know
That you were here when you’re goneThank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, hahaYeah
Oh
Yeah
Everybody said that you let me down
Hesitation bring the "you" around
Makes no difference what you used to do
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I could never
Maybe you were reckless yesterday
I'm convinced you know a better way, I know it
Some would judge based on what you've been through but
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I, I could never 
You've told me things
Harsh truth to my face
I've been told to walk away 
I could never
Things that I would choose to do with you if I had time though
Thousand times I fucked you in my mind, trust me I know
Everybody said that I let you down
And let the truth but I can still be found, yeah
Lost my way and only you were there
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Could you ever, yeah
Could you ever
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Sometimes I ask how you could ever want me
How could you choose that you would ever love me
Yours were the truest eyes I'd ever seen
To be in a stare right back at me
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Could you ever
Could you ever
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Could you ever
Why can't you everFalling fast and falling free
You look to find a friend
Falling fast and falling free
This could just be the end
Falling fast, you stoop to touch
And kiss the flowers that bend
And you're ready now

Got a condo and I couldn’t even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to TSX
To people wondering if its the Phantom he gets next
Who knows, its the rabbit its buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin he’s feeling
Its kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasn’t really around when it wasn’t appealing
Now its denim diamonds an perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in
What girl that wasn’t me who’s verse you saying
Shit I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other niggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I don’t forget the past
And you gave me nothing so I’m gonna give you nothing right back, like…
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…
Young, dumb, looking in the mirror
Trying to figure out who Im gonna be this year
Its funny you managed to be around for the present
All puns intended your funds are mended
If I take back the cheddar it'll better for both us
No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a call from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this ain't hollywood squares to me
Sweetie I’m far from a hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if its not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasn’t in it, fine
But try to get a start at the finish line
Ah
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…Don't you have a word to show what may be done?
Have you never heard a way to find the sun?
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say if you know the way to blue?
Have you seen the land living by the breeze?
Can you understand a light among the trees?
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Tell us all today if you know the way to blue?
Look through time and find your rhyme
Tell us what you find
We will wait at your gate
Hoping like the blind
Can you now recall all that you have known?
Will you never fall when the light has flown?
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say if you know the way to blue?Shit's all good
The deal got signed
And my split's all good
And these haters pretending
That it's all good
Say that shit in person
Man I wish ya'll would
I'm a mothafucking genius goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you
I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat
If you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket
And these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chilling in the cut, nigga what
And I'm feeling like
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
Here I go
Street report
Balling over here
We need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house look something like a resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
When this money run slower than Eyore
If your life is a movie you an extra
I'm so fly, I glide Clyde Drexler
Mr. Pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now
Fuck next up
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie

I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homieIt's the Ruler
I know I'm a problem
2-2-3 shells if I see red and Robin Hood
Venus and Serena, all the diamonds up on my neck
I mud walked through Barneys but in Neimans I dropped a check
Hating ass nigga, faking ass nigga
Always staring at my table ass nigga
Get some money, niggas funny, I pegged him, Al Bundy
I'm riding with antique silverware on the lunch tray
The road, Willie Nelson, you baby boy, Melvin
Up in hell but it's cold tryna hard rock with Elvis
Presley, don't test me, this modified XD
Just let the birds fly, we finna slaughter the messenger
Money on my mind, head tats like a Mexican
My wrist named me the president, niggas ain't pressing
Shit sippin' on this mud, lord said it's my destiny
Niggas wanna step to me, flu flamm, dead on scene
Niggas politicking, they get dropped for Twitter mentions
Dropping shells on his block and hit his mom and see the witness
Droppin' Wock in my pop, when I bop I take prescriptions
Hear the rubber band pop on my knots, I just hit a lick
Stop it with the scheming, Stinkies have you screaming in a ditch
Knock a nigga's dreads off for talking like a bitch
Heavy metal, rock and roll, I might knock at the moshpit
In a mansion backyard feeling like a locksmith
I'm robbing, I'm 'bout more green than a goblin
If I go broke, shit I'm serving my bitch tonsils
Clown ass niggas remind me of Willy Wonka
Drakeo got the Draco, 'bout to get rid of the politics, gang
Stinc Team, it's the flu flamm bleed team
Ding dong ditch, nobody's home, we finna bleed the scene
Door knock, it's the front door, stove popper
Climb through your window like the Grinch, fuck your Christmas
Flu flamming, snatching presents off your wishlist
Got niggas mad, all in they feelings, having bitch fits
Pouring up fours, got they hoes tryna lick dick
Please don't run up on me or we gon' flip shit
Moncler coat 'cause it get cold in the winter
Niggas ain't getting no dough, they pretending
Bust down, bust down, I know you see my neck froze
Bitch come fuck with a P, we can get dough, the Plug

Longstocking
Longstocking
Pippi Longstocking
Longstocking
I had to shut the show down, bitchThey say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy
Now I'm out in A-Town
They tellin' me Trey sound
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purposeless game
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on
 I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
 I'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all
Yeah
Let me show you how to blast up
Now tell me who is a masta
A mind never wasted
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up
See where we from, the 50's are bloody
And the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown, they love me
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of
My lapel, is custom made
You off the rack shit
I'm off the chain, come on
The dogs are loose
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With 40 and Mac Dre
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk
Drake'll give you the deal
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill
Keep on, keep on , keep on , keep on 
Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda
Ol' time killin'
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin'
And now the girls like
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin'
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin'
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And  now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold
And keep on, on, on, on, onOliver Set

Ayy, yeah
Trend setter, Ben Frank getter
Whip whatever, whip whatever
I buy diamonds when I'm under pressure
When I buy shit, don’t ever let up, yeah
Look, I'm in the cut, the boy in the cut
Jump in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up
All of this grindin' for what?
It’s funny when you niggas thought it was luck
I cannot give you a pass if you play with my money and family and friends
And I compete with myself while you niggas competin' with trends
Your foreign is used, I looked up the VIN
I know the truth, no use in pretendin' with him
I'm still in the cut, the boy in the cut
Hop in the whip when the ceilings go up, we up
Go way up at the top of the loft
Gotta stay up, ain't no knockin' me off
Pull up smooth, we out with the cross, damn
Countin' up wins on wins on wins, for all of my dawgs I lost
I might call for real, spend the new Chanel
Thugger got the YSL, huh
I remember when the Feds did this sweep, I pray my dawgs didn't tell, huh
Couldn’t risk it all for lyin’, she gave me top with the top off
Cartier wrist, gave that or an Audemar, she got a hand, it's soft, soft
You ain’t gettin' money, you ain't fuckin' with me
You ain’t in your bitch top, forever
I might pull up in the Six with Drizzy
I was just in Houston fuckin' with mob ties
We don't never ever play two sides
Hang out the Phantom, it's suicide
They right in my way like a road sign
But my necklace is wet like the pool side
Still in the cut, the boy in the cut, yeah
Hop in the whip when the ceilings go up, we up
ChyeahUh, uh-uh
Why are we in Chanel talkin' 'bout life and shit?
Got my emotions on open mic and shit
Fancy, all this pink champagne on ice and shit
Off one glass, girl, I can see how nice you get
Buzzin' your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
I know, you know, I'm in too deep to let it go
I know, you know, it’s in my nature to get distant
I know it's been a year since I left you alone
Unfortunate, I think you know there's somethin' missin'
But you never say shit, don't know how to take it
We're good on our own, but
I miss being on Wiltshire at your place, and
I drink you under tables, got you misbehavin'
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over meEpisode 1

- John McSwainAlright, well alright
I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture won't do me Justice League in this bitch
I’ma do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you can’t touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario
Coming through ya stereo
Plus my girlfriend booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motha fucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isn’t at my session
Mr Anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE
I’m up too high somebody come get me down down down down
Said I’m up too high somebody get me down down down down
Look, my ex girl said she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
Not me I make your battle ships capsize
Get soaked get wet get baptized
I got the full package a nigga complete
I get bread and eat tracks like lunch meat
Sue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
I’m much more then you fathom he would be
And ain't too many niggas that I’d rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these niggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONEYo, what's going on? This is Drake
And I'ma let you know what you about to witness
This right here is a Drake and DJ Smallz collaboration
So I'm from Canada, my man's from down South
Ya understand, the number one DJ in the South to be exact
You heard that in the VMAs, you heard that wherever he goes
My man Smalls is out there, down south
Same time, reppin' for Toronto, Canada
Ya know what I mean?
So this right here, listening to right now is the official Southern Smoke Special Edition
I call it the "Room For Improvement" mixtape, cause I'm not perfect
And I bet neither are you if you listening
So you need to just accept what's there, know what I mean?
But look, you need to just let this play out
From track one, to track whatever, however-many-I-put-on-here
You need to just listen to this cause look man, this is the first time
Canadian, down south, my man, Smallz, your boy, Drake
You know what it is man, so just tune in niggaWho can know the thoughts of Mary Jane?
Why she flies, or goes out in the rain
Where she's been, and who she's seen
In her journey to the stars
Who can know the reason for her smile?
What are her dreams when they've journeyed for a mile?
The way she sings, and her brightly-coloured rings
Make her the princess of the sky
Who can know what happens in her mind?
Did she come from a strange world and leave her mind behind?
Her long-lost sighs, and her brightly-coloured eyes
Tell her story to the wind
Who can know the thoughts of Mary Jane?
Why she flies, or goes out in the rain
Where she's been, and who she's seen
In her journey to the starsIntro

But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me: Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody gotta deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button  nothin' man
Now super bad chicks givin' me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques, just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out, and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
Okay, hello it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur "to the top"
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke, this cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know, rap will never be same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains who stand inside of a booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up outta of our mouths
Now rewind it
Pay back mothafucka for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever manTune in to OVO Sound Radio today at 10:45 PM EST / 7:45 PM PT on Apple's Beats 1 Radio! This page will be live-updated during the show, complete with the songs played and a link to their lyrics. If you know any songs that we don't, feel free to leave a comment below!

EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON SWEET THING
Forever Fif
Eye of HorusPop goes the weasel, we in another kick door
If anybody hungry, brains all on your french toast
Seen Maylene choosin' when she see how my wrist broke
Send two-two-threes at his heart for thinking he Kimbo
Tying my Christian Loubs, I think I see the Jimbos
Mr. Mosely, everybody know I get dough
Announce yourself before you claiming that we kinfolk
It's Presidents Day every time I let my wrist show
When aiming the beam, only time I let some shit go
Drakeo keep acting up, know I gotta let that shit show
Catastrophes, tragically, every time I write a hit song
Your majesty, clap for me, got the Tommy when I sit down
Toe tagger, the AMG a 4Matic
You can die in these streets, ain't no time for romancing
Mud walking in Neimans, niggas thinking I'm slow dancing
Twenty strip in the air, have to cover the pole dancers
That's just me, back for the fee, I'm on it
Clapping the heat, these rats in the streets get slaughtered
Talk blasphemy to me, you making the news in the morning
We joking and laughing, your mom and your pappy they mourning
Know the time of death but we gon' leave that to the coroner
Donor, these contractors need dough, Homer
Bambino what you call that? I think four goners
Wanna catch up with me, you need at least four blowers
I can be humble when I'm forty
These old niggas wanna rap beef with me, ain't you 'bout forty?

And the sea she will sigh
But she won't need to cry
For it's really too hard for to flyWell, there was a man
Lived in a shed
Spent most of his days out of his head
For his shed was rotten let in the rain
Said it was enough to drive any man insane
When it rained he felt so bad
When it snowed he felt just simply sad
Well, there was a girl who lived nearby
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh
But she lived in a house so very big and grand
For him it seemed like some very distant land
So when he called her
His shed to mend
She said "I’m sorry, you’ll just have to find a friend"
Well, this story is not so very new
But the man is me, yes, and the girl is you
So leave your house come into my shed
Please stop my world from raining through my head
Please don’t think I’m not your sort
You’ll find that sheds are nicer than you thoughtLadies and Gentlemen
We are now broadcastin live from London England
Back then it was me plus you, we us two did every single thing that we must do
You trust me, me trust you, plus there's no one else that I see just you
Now a days I'm riding on the bandwagon driver of a porche caiyan wagon
Ice in the necklace light skinned and hectic and all these simple things got a man braggin
And boastin a little never drank much in the past but now they got the kid toastin a little
So cheers to the fact you here in the track you shoulda been shotgun his career in the back
And his two month lease expires right now knew I shoulda got me a truck with two front seats I assume it's
Done I'm lookin at my passenger side I realize that there's room for one oh
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Now a days you be all cried out no more tears no more planes cause you all flyed out
Need the lord in your life on a Sunday no more fashion nomore spendin your life on the runway
Deal with it you hardly can all this hype around Drake whatever happened to Aubrey Graham
Well it's her he’s needin you gotta say leave in the word but I know leavin has crossed your mind
You jealous of some autographs I often sign I try to make it to dinner never often time
But I often find myself hearin your voice you said you never felt a touch soft as mine
I was sayin how the range and the loft is mine had to change in the planes and the porche is mine
It's a deal I was forced to sign but I never imagined that youd end up fourth in line no
Shes got a feelin lonely 
Like she don't even know me 
I thought that she would be the one for me but now I see that
If I could turn back the hands of time she would be mine
You’re on my mind girl let's rewind it back
Look this for that girl that you use to see for anybody that want it how it use
To be all the love afection and all the cash I wanna rewind but we movin forward fast
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
And I adore all the pictures that everyone in the media is dyin for
Back when there was one camera to smile for
There was only couple things I could buy you compared to now where I'm kinda like heres a thou
Drop grands through appear in style but I could still be chillin in sweat pants and a stainless ring
Without you I havnt gained a thing oh
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cause I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your schedule
Now there's no time I see so one plus you and minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it backDamn V-O, sounds like you got a lot of niggas mad at you bruh. Guess that's what happens when uh, you a R&B Diva tryna live a rapper's life. You know what I'm saying. But um, if you really want it with me man I got you, I'mma show you what it is to get exposed, I hope I'm on key, hahaha
The V-O-Y I'm talking to you
And both them record deals that ain't never go through
OK Voyce, we know you was a snitch
But you don't get your boys back like that
Still need a ride, you ain't gettin paid
And Taj got you at them shoots wearing pink shades
OK Voyce, always knew you a bitch
But I ain't know you got down like that
I hear you issuing threats, you need to kill the jive talk
Furthest thing from street bruh, that's why I call you sidewalk
We here waiting, if you stupid then try it
How you gon' knock me out lookin' like Snoop on a diet?
Uh, listen slim fast, we all know that
The only time that you raisin' up the shooters is in the gym class
This ain't dooms day, this today and after
This a diss track from your sister's favorite rapper
Oh man... Yo V-O man let's reminisce for a second man, we been through a lot of shit man. Like um, you remember when, you remember when you used to kick it at Jazzy's studio yo? And you used to make fun of Rahmel and say that he looked so old that if you punched him in the face, his head might turn to dust yo. I remember that, and you used to make of Diggs too man and now you like, standing side by side with him cuttin' records, I think that shit funny man. Ayo Boi-1da you remember the time he told us about um, knockin' some dude out back in uh, what was it college, university man, but really, he got his ass laid out and had to call D10 to come fix him up . Oh man. let's get back into the track
Ho, I hope this ego trip you on won't last honey
Cause everyone you get around got you gas money
And where the cash at? Nigga speakin' of gas money
We all had to give you lifts, isn't that funny?
It's real talk, you know better I don't play that
He tell you I'mma liar, I figured that he would say that
But this the same nigga that be talkin' about a Maybach
And can't make a move from his momma house in Ajax
Dawg, I mean, you just shit on everybody, b. And that's ya problem man, I'm about loyalty man. I mean, I remember when you told me that D10 better pull his act together or else he gon' be babysittin' ya kids man, damn! You done shit on Sho, Me, Symphony, Andreena, Carmen, Lanny, Jazzy, Promise. Man, you done made fun of everybody over at Maxamus Melanie, Taj, Rahmel, Diggs. You said you was gonna knock ex out. You even made fun of Boi-1da when I wasn't around. I mean dog, you, you just a unloyal cat man  and this the commitment right here, Heartfelt music, ho! Ya man Toronto I got you for the next two summers don't even worry man. Yeah, shout out to everybody I know, everybody that's down with me that know that they down with me man. Precise waddup, Jason Johnson waddup, Niko waddup, Janyelle I see you baby and I know you seeing Niko, hahahWhat's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
I wish you could see
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda, coulda, wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin' my time
'Cause she heard it all
'Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But you heard it all
Well I'ma say it anyway
Shawty, I'm from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You ain't gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I'm just tryna say
I'm from the city, oh
Where the money makes a difference
But it never made us different, ohFrom the second he drops you off
That's when you stopped blowing me up
Telling me to come over
Acting like you've got controller
Just when I thought that I had enough
That's when I remembered you touch
After the weekend in Florida
How could I ever ignore ya
Know that when it goes hot
Can always hit my phone up
Know it's only luck
You call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, lonely
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Wasting no time girl you're on my body
You're trembling, I bet you want me
Baby, you can't resist it
I back up put you insist it
You told me that it's alright
So I take you into the night
But it hurts me touch ya
'Cause I know he loves ya
Know that when it goes hot
Can always hit my phone up
Know it's only luck
You call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, lonely
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
What is you delusional
Take the time that I put into loving you can never be me just using you
My body waved like an ocean when I'm cruising you
To the Isley Brothers, "Groove With You"
Triangle in love and I'm craving in love
And I'm sorry if I'm angry in love, but this is dangerous love
 me up
I know enough is enough but I can't enough
Call me!
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Know that when it goes hot
Can always hit my phone up
Know it's only luck
You call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, lonelyA city freeze, get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper
A city drought, you're down and out
See your trousers don't taper
Saddle up, kick your feet
Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again
And at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armour down
Stay indoors, beneath the floors
Talk with neighbours only
The games you play make people say
You're either weird or lonely
A city star won't shine too far
On account of the way you are
And the beads around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place
And at the beat of a city drum
See how your friends come
In twos, or threes, or more
For the sound of a busy place
Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for
The city clown will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in
And he will lose if he won't choose
The one he may confide in
Sonny boy with smokes for sale
Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard about the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range
In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride
But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armour downWith today being the 5th anniversary of So Far Gone I figured it's fitting to return to it's place of its origin in order to clear the air about an extremely emotional day. I completely support and agree with Rolling Stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication. My frustration stemmed from the way it was executed. The circumstances at hand are completely justifiable , but I was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating. They ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not. I would have waited until it was my time because I understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but I just wasn't given that option and that made me feel violated. I apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would I ever want to offend the Hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment. I am still the same person. Today I was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly. These days are the worst ones. Waking up after a great night in the studio and it's your day to be picked apart. After dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time. So here I am having that moment. I once again apologize to everybody who took my cover comments the wrong way. I respect Rolling Stone for being willing to give a kid from Toronto a shot at the cover. I guess this is a day to learn and grow.
Sincerely,
The BoyJ.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in "Jodeci Freestyle". I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J. Cole and I believe that it is the right, responsible, and respectful decision to remove the lyric from the song.Bless them

Lou Val - Learn To LoveHey there material girl
The neighbors told me that you're moving out
Leaving to witness the world
But are you sure that's what you're doing now
Are you running away for a purpose
Do you even know what your self worth is
The passport you carry in your purse is
The gift in the curse when you going head first is
The ATL, MIA, LAX, JFK
Luggage all packed and to them I say
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray
You wander the world
You seek what you've lost
You're waking up every day
The run away, run away girl
I turn and your gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
The run away, the run away girl
So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on
Your way
Run away girl
Watching it all through the window
And wishing you could make it shatter now
Now that you're here on the other side
Are you sure it even matters
Are you living the dream
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems
Do you strip do you model do you live in between
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like
You wander the world
You seek what you lost
You're waking up every day
To run away, run away girl
I turn and you're gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
You run away, run away girl
So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on your way
Run away girlPut that Christian Dior on a Muslim, she feelin' like she was sinnin'
Her family lose faith in a genocide, I told 'em bring 'em all to Finland
I don't mean to admire you, just passion, I'm winnin' 
Had to double back up my double-cup, yeah, yeah
You gotta put up out the city, she can't get any closer
Especially when you're driving a bandwagon after
You gotta put 'em on, she like that
Ayy, I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
'Cause you got desires
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees everyday, had to talk to Messiah
I'm in that '81 and this that '82, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all of your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city
You actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I shoulda moved you away from Houston, before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the section
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you 
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
'Cause you got desires
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
'Cause you got desires
You should have did what you said you would'd do
You should be movin' in silence
See the type girl you hang with, the wildest
Need a better environment
I bought bags to fill up your closet
I pop tags, I know where I'm rounded
I do the dashes, get higher than the mountain
You need class to be with a celebrity
So sad, you lookin' like charity
What you wanna do? See niggas bury me?
All of my brothers are black, carry me
I can't answer you through the legacy
At the embassy speak, it was like therapy
Bought a Patek Philippe in your currency
Bitches can't keep it real with a nigga movin' so desperately
You the one that did the Twitter shit first to see how these hoes react
The only one that can make me feel some way 'cause I love you back
You wanna be my queen, niggas fuckin' on you, think I'ma take you back?
Your bags are secured at home, relax
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know 
'Cause you got desires
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
California, Santa Barbara, you know, an early retirement 
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I knowOliver Set

ZHU x Majid Jordan - Coming HomeWe tramped the open moorland in the rainy April weather
And came upon the little inn that we had found together
The landlord gave us toast and tea and stopped to share a joke
And I remember firelight
I remember firelight
I remember firelight
And you remember smoke
We ran about the meadow grass with all the harebells bending
And shaking in the summer wind, a summer never-ending
We wandered to the little stream among the river flats
And I remember willow trees
I remember willow trees
I remember willow trees
And you remember gnats
We strolled the Spanish marketplace at 90 in the shade
With all the fruit and vegetables so temptingly arrayed
And we can share a memory as every lover must
And I remember oranges
I remember oranges
I remember oranges
And you remember dust
The autumn leaves are tumbling down and winter's almost here
But through the spring and summertime we laughed away the year
And now we can be grateful for the gift of memory
For I remember having fun
Two happy hearts that beat as one
When I had thought that we were "we"
But we were "you and me"Do you curse where you come from? Do you swear in the night?
Would it mean much to you if I treat you right?
Do you like what you're doing? Would you do it some more?
Or will you stop once and wonder what you're doing it for?
Hey slow, Jane, make sense
Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence
Do you feel like a remnant of something that's past?
Do you find things are moving just a little too fast?
Do you hope to find new ways of quenching your thirst?
Do you hope to find new ways of doing better than your worst?
Hey slow Jane, let me prove
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move
Do it for you
Sure that you would do the same for me one day
So try to be true
Even if it's only in your hazey way
Can you tell if you're moving with no mirror to see?
If you're just riding a new man who looks a little like me
Is it all so confusing? Is it hard to believe?
When the winter is coming can you sign up and leave
Hey slow, Jane, clear your eye
Slow, slow, Jane, fly on byYou see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom. After this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm. What you got?ComebackVerse:
Yeah yeah uh
I'm feelin' you, gauranteed that you into me
I got the phantom, the aston, the bent-e-ley
But let me tell you where a nigga at mentally
Two things I don't give a bitch: pay checks and sympathy
Ha! but I guess it's just the pimp in me
All around paid, can't even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart, sentence me
I ain't worried it's gon happen if it's meant to be
And if you ever feel the need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we living seperate lives
Trying to tell you, less feelings mean less goodbyes
That's some game for your ass, better recognize
But some cats can't even relate
I ain't a mind reader though, so if you tryna escape
Then let me know that, show that
My place, roll back, lay down, so flat
Tell Me!Lifting the mask from a local clown
Feeling down like him
Seeing the light in a station bar
And travelling far in sin
Sailing downstairs to the northern line
Watching the shine of the shoes
Hearing the trials of the people there
Who's to care if they lose?
Take a look, you may see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town
Dancing a jig in a church with chimes
A sign of the times today
Hearing no bell from the steeple tall
People all in dismay
Falling so far on a silver spoon
Making the moon for fun
Changing a robe for a size too small
People all get hung
Take a look, you may see me coming through
For I am the parasite who travels two-by-two
When I'm lifting the mask from a local clown
And feeling down like him
And I'm seeing the light in a station bar
And travelling far in sin
And I'm sailing downstairs to the northern line
Watching the shine of the shoes
And hearing the trials of the people there
Who's to care if they lose?
Take a look, you may see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town
And take a look you may see me in the dirt
For I am the parasite who hangs from your skirtSpend ten racks on a new chain
My bitch love do cocaine, ooh

Her days are over. Baby she's over

No option for her, you sayin' no

Follow my lead, whatchu waitin' fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya
I'm in control, but with you bein' a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya

So keep thinkin' you the man
Cause it's all part of my plan

I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental picture, no cameras please
Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind
Flash, black lingerie white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast
Define fast, cause I can speed it up, and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure you never forget it, commited, im ready, im with it
Still here like a statue, pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got bagges, well im packed too, plus I got a sex pistol
Pointed right at you "BANG!", the baddest women ever in the heart of south
Proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt, plus im
Young money 'till the death, I took the carter route
Im more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about
Artist: DrakeShoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda coulda wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin’ my time
'Cause she heard it all
'Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But she heard it all
Well, I'ma say it anyway shawty
I’m the from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You ain’t gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I’m just tryna say
I’m the from the city, oh
Where the money makes a difference
But it never made us different, ohI Promise, I try College
Did it but I quit it they couldn't define knowledge
For me, I got it, So I’m honest
He living, Spitting Wisdom with some of the top artists
Who are not flawless, but my part is
Yet they don't see what I'm doing is not 
They like, Promise, why bother
Well living in the sewer, it’s filled up with hot garbage
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me
If this don't sell, Imma make it sell
And criticism's invited, I take it well
My savings account got a vacant smell
And priorities shift when you take a L
Every time I feel like leaving
Somebody'll play Comeback Season
And that'll give me enough of a reason
To stand outside trying to jingle my keys and
I guess I'm attached to her
Can't fathom going back to a bachelor
When you've been in a Range since you started high school
It’s hard going back to the Acura
Yeah, yeah
So Imma stick around as the rain trickle down and the cars get sold
These rappers is all thickle but a ways it could sound
Full of loud and go and put her face to the town
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me
You got me
And you got me
And you got me
When I said I’m not a rapper it's not cause I am
It’s cause my momma said I'm not like them
I don't look like them
I don't act like them
Only way you know I rap is if you see me rappin’
And I am the truth I can't lie
Hand on the bible in the booth with punch lines
And New York City dumb high
Too much champagne
Threw it up like gang signs
You wanna know if you got me?
Then watch me
But watch me through a train, I
Cause I am Sacario
The same guy
Who flow like
Flow like agua
We don't like no fake, nada
Rappin' ass actor,you need an Oscar
And the world know who I are
Why you think Promise featured a pop star?
Sacario
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got meI like this type of shit, perkies no Vicodins

It's hotter than hell's kitchen, Longstocking when I'm whippin'
I got kamikaze visions, on the block where it's relentless
These niggas choosin' when they picking, I refuse to be that nigga
Double cup, sippin' mud, dodging school and detention

Tell these niggas stop sneak dissing me. We not with the social media shit, what I say is a catalogue of caskets, pick and choose. DeadI never felt magic crazy as this
I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
But now you're here
Brighten my northern sky
I've been a long time that I'm waiting
Been a long time that I'm blown
I've been a long time that I've wandered
Through the people I have known
Oh, if you would and you could
Straighten my new mind's eye
Would you love me for my money?
Would you love me for my head?
Would you love me through the winter?
Would you love me 'til I'm dead?
Oh, if you would and you could
Come blow your horn on high
I never felt magic crazy as this
I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
But now you're here
Brighten my northern skyYeah, it's Drake, KC
We was just walking
Just smiling and talking
Then add to my surprise
Got lost in your eyes
This time they were different
And I found what it meant
After I leaned in I helplessly fell in
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love
In love and I can't see
What's happening to me
You blinded my thoughts
From what pain and tears taught
See my hearts been broken before
It don't trust love anymore
One kiss from you
I just felt myself fall right through
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love
Got me hypnotized with your magic spell
I got butterflies, can't control myself
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you
It's true, don't know what to do
Don't stop now
Since I let you in
You showed me how
You showed me how to love again
And there's no reason why
I can't give you a try 
'Cause it feels so right
Look, previously mischievous behavior
Was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some considerable degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But ugh, Keshia, Keshia do you remember the old us?
We would never be together, is what they told us
From immature kids to entrepreneur kids
We bought our own dreams instead of the ones they sold us
Keep it a hundred, what they sayin' I'm a liar for?
Airing laundry, that's what I got a dryer for
What are they even searching through attire for?
Tellin' you these stories bout lonely women that I ignore
Callin' them out is red rover to me
To them it's a dream, its just a rare rover to me
See I'm passionate and focused
I don't know how they expect a Scorpio born in October to be, but ugh
I'm going in, check
Look, previously mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But now, I need a culprit
I am talking lofts and beach condo adult shit
I am talking all day shopping sprees at the mall with, friends that I ball with, here meet T's girl, go and get some fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise. I will kill this song until it actually dies
With a military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best until the stats arrive
And all these A-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside, its only slacks and ties
But you dont ever act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy until the plaques arrives
Thats why I love you
I've fallen please help meAre you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
The type of life you first timers could soak in
That virgin pussy's waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated, I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em', and keep em'
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heaven's our's
And you don't see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, that's a pensive look there
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
And yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged
Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch
I don't ever pay a percentage of the retail
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
You was having hoop dreams
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Young money old accounts
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts

Talkin' 'bout it's two tone, lil nigga you'll get tombstoned
Fresh up out a new home, Celine on my shoe clothes
Nigga it get tricky if Ricky up in the Loub store
Bathing Ape cape and shit, nobody can tame the kid
This that 2016 blood on my Maison shit
Blatantly, strangling niggas who like to fake the funk
Please kill it with all that fools gold, talkin' 'bout it's two tone
These clown niggas give me new songs, nigga what is you on?
I'm tired of arguing with camera on
Chopper hanging out my loose drawers
Kill it with all that fools gold, talkin' 'bout it's two tone
These clown niggas give me new songs, nigga what is you on?
I'm tired of arguing with camera on
Chopper hanging out my loose drawers
Chopper hanging out my loose drawers
Too tall, Luke Walton, too smart
Not one of these new boys, bomb this bitch, Kim Un
Fools ball, fools gold, talkin' 'bout it's two tone
Niggas out, you know, bye bitch, kudos
Big Banc sumo, nigga I'm the uno
Feed me all blue notes, pictures on tombstones
Money in your head, you the nigga walking dead
Make it rain like confetti, kicking sauce like spaghetti
Y'all eye busters, leave a nigga face like Fetty
Y'all niggas ain't ready, I could tell from the beginning
I can verify the envy, you can't stand another ending
Join the team that's winning
Please kill it with all that fools gold, talkin' 'bout it's two tone
These clown niggas give me new songs, nigga what is you on?
I'm tired of arguing with camera on

Ayy
It was meant to happen, the most trusted going triple platinum
Link with Mac, link with Fe, if I'm down in Baton
Link with Tez, link with C, when I'm down in Jackson
Just got back, overseas I was the main attraction
This ain't them, this is me, so you know what's crackin'
I mean there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I got to make it out"
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instrumentsI don't rap beef, soul snatch that ass deep
Grim reaper, street sweeper, feet Neimans, speak to me
Codiene and Adderall, Bally bags and Taliban
I could’ve went to Alcatraz, niggas always talking bad
Please check the news clips, I do this, a nuisance
Wildin' all in traffic with a Uzi, on buffoonery
You cool as me, I do this shit, I’m strangling Judas's
Don’t play with me, I’m chasing niggas
Bitch you bought the major leagues
Long stocking, Pippy Longstocking
More problems, more bodies
Won’t find ‘em, Local 8’s is getting crowded
I got Bally, I got Louis, I ain’t really into Prada
Split medulla oblongata's, a couple way from a father
Abuse these Margielas, my jacket is Moncler
So it ain’t rappers on my toes, these are not Air Forces
Mr. Everything, I stood on thirty thousand on the floor
Three-sixty bust down and I was not doing no shows
You need to go back to your hood 'cause we is not bringing no hoes
Chopsticks, mopsticks, Ralfy blinding the moshpit
Disgusting, suck me, bitch the fit been musty
The nerve of me cursing, I’m slurring, I’m curving these dirty birds
A five in a one, who the fuck I think I’m Dirty Purp
Gheesy my people, drummer stinky bleachers
I break the internet with my freestyles from Pro Tools
Don’t know you, these niggas really Venice Beach hobos
Rapper with a gun, I go bad, I got a drum
Spilling bricks all up in Neimans, I be acting up off mud
She said if you needed help then you should've asked for some

To see you fly
You don't have to wander

If I may
You're never in my way
And all I can say is you saved me
Changed all the things that have made me
Entertaining, thoughts are raining
Down we fall
It's all okay

You and I

Real sentimental but your body is righteous
Tight as I want it
Tight as my lips when I lock them in silence
And your cellphone is ringin' and you're worried 'bout somethin'
And you're walkin' outside on me now
Which side are you on again?
What phone does he have your in?
What time do you leave again?
How long do we just stay friends?
What role I play again?
We can't even make new friends
I'm here with no moves again
I need to know how to stay, ayy
That's all I need, that's all I need
Believe me girl, that's all I need
Ooh, that's all I need, that's all I need
Do you really love me girl? That's all I need, yeah
All this flexin' , she call me the best thing 
Your body is a blessin'
Baby know the body really waits for the undressin'
No wait, I love when you grind on me
Roll up your tongue pon di ting slowly
Yeah I know what I want to be, you're a 
Put down the iPhone, stop text
Badmon ting, Canadian flex
Gyal mi don't care 'bout your ex, mi only want weed and sex
Concerned for your time, concerned for your time
Concerned for your timeT. Slack, I promise I got 'em, homie!
I turn the phone off, I let the seat back
I'mma be out for a minute, I'll bring the heat back
The jet-setta and forever will I get chedda
And y'all will only get cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Plus, the hoodie cover my eyes
I'm too pretty, nah, I'm just playin'
Heavy is how I weigh in
Top floor with a view of the water is what I stay in
But y'all don't hear me, yeah, y'all ain't relatin'
Well, let me tell you what happens when I be datin'
These chicks with ass fully skip they class
Catch me at the hotel and try and get they cash
But, I'm not stupid, nah -- I'm tight fisted
You tryna sex me for money is quite twisted
Prior to fall, I was lying to y'all
So if you gettin' one ring, I'm denyin' ya call
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doing his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feeling where he's at let him know
He just doing his thing
Gotta love that
Now my momma kinda iffy, My uncle kinda shifty
Expenses at this point have cost a little over fifty
The hummer and the range was in someone else's name
Hope my city's reputation for the summer's gonna change
I hope you stick around and see it
Cause if you ain't around I'll bring your chick around to see it
Until she catch feelings and I have to let her go
And when I park my car outside she'll stick around and key it
Repercussions of a cheap lash
Had me doing repaints, just to get em re-scratched
And get attached do insane things
Take new jewelry and put it down the drain things
But, that's just the drama that the fame brings
Fresh prince tryna touch sky like
Mr. Busy, Mr. Recieve the shipment
It's Mr. big dreams, no more than 2 months commitment

Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doin his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feelin where he's at let him know
He just doin his thing
Gotta love thatPart of me wished I can meet with
All you haters in person, they got a lot of
Feelings for me they just ain't certain. How to
Express themselves when I walk into the club and
Take stares like the fuckin elevators ain workin
Yeah. Cause they know the promoter pays you, you wouldn't
Have come if somebody hadn't of made you, you just looking
Forward to seeing women that played you and shitting
On the men they get engaged to, I swear it's like. Uh
More confidence and less fear. We can discuss it further
When y'all manage to get here. Diddy here, O here
Skinny here, Rex here and we just having one of them conversations
About next year. I`ma kill it, I promise that`s how I know you
Mad. I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads. The
Big homie use a flash if you must and I swear I ain't asking
For much, all I want is the
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Hip-hop is like school, yeah I had to
Learn it. Beef is like a blank disc, yeah
I had to burn it. They finally showing me
Respect but I had to earn it. I'm heading to
The finishing line, ain't got no time for
U-turns. Today I realise that I'm not perfect
Everything I did to get here wasn't really worth it
Why won't they just let me be great. You fall down seven
Times you stand up eight. Realise true happiness lies
Inside of you. Everyday give yourself a mental shampoo
The birds singing after the motherfukin` storm gone. If you
Want to sing, you can always sing this song. Turn my swag
On, this my theme song, there`s 95 per-cent chance that I used to
Be your ringtone. I got swissel and cheese but I don't yodel
Heart tatted on my neck they love my vocal
As I sit back and spit this crack and leaking
On the internet and watch my haters react
50 said they can't read between the lines so
I jab, uppercut, punchline after punchline
I know you thinking damn Soulja going hard
Right now. And I'm thinking damn this is just the
Start right now. Soulja Boy is going on a renegade
If life give you lemons make lemonade
Uh, no one person on this earth can change their past
But every single person on this earth can start today
And change their future. That`s real shit. Beezy
Soulja Boy I tell 'emOh i dedicate to you.
To you.
To you.
I dedicate.
And you know who you are.

Spent to much time in the fast lane.
And I just had enough, baby I dont think I like this.

Maybe a little treat.
But its never easy.

So why the hell we go our separate ways.
So baby, can we talk it out.

I dedicate to you, you, youuu.
Listen, sometimes things dont go right the first time. But if its meant to be, you'll push through it.Never sing for my supper
I never help my neighbour
Never do what is proper
For my fair share of labour
I'm a poor boy
And I'm a rover
Count your coins and
Throw them over my shoulder
I may grow older
Nobody knows
How cold it grows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If I cross their stiles
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonight
Never know what I came for
Seems that I've forgotten
Never ask what I came for
Or how I was begotten
I'm a poor boy
And I'm a ranger
Things I say
May seem stranger than Sunday
Changing to Monday
Nobody knows
How cold it flows
And nobody feels
The worn down heels
Nobody's eyes
Make the skies
Nobody spreads
Their aching heads
He's a mess but he'll say yes
If you just dress in white
Nobody knows
How cold it blows
And nobody sees
How shaky my knees
Nobody cares
How steep my stairs
And nobody smiles
If I cross their stiles
You may say every day
Where will he stay tonightSheesh, I guess this a three-peat huh
Girl that's Drakeo, it's gettin' kinda hard to breath huh, uhh
Girl I can't be no rebound
Ten cases in a month, I don't know who gon' refile
Put that draco down Drakeo, these niggas talkin'
Where your table in the club, lil nigga don't even talk to us
Walk it out, put a beam on it and chalk him out
Had to slide through your hood and show out, fuck you talkin' 'bout lethal?
Mr. Glover, my weapons lethal
I tried to tell you I'm a heathen, done shared beds with demons
Done had long walks with Jesus
Get you whacked from your people, yeah it's really that easy
What he get for tryna be me
We at his gravesite cheesin', another day with the Stinc Team
You know I bop bop ming ming
And had a meet and greet with ling ling
Come on this shit regular
Bullets flying all at the messenger
I'm a machine gun specialist, plain jane with the bezel busted
Nigga you broke and it's disgusting
Remember Fake Watch Busta, ain't really with all that tussling
Come on this shit nothin'
Use guns with acrynoms for niggas wanna cuff me
Pissing on tombstones, the boy the McLovin
Tryna tell you I was thuggin' lil nigga, so fuck a deal
One day my autograph gon' be worth 'bout a couple mill
It's regular, I tried to tell you I'm thugging still
One day my autograph gon' be worth 'bout a couple mill
The Ruler 
I'm Mr. Everything
Got a drum, got a beam, I got pills, I got dough, I got lean
Bitch I bought everything
Niggas trippin' in the club, so what
I ain't really tryna scuff, I let off everything
Niggas lyin' in they raps, that's a fact
Who these pussy niggas jack, my image is everything
From the gold, from the watch
From the stove to my frozen earlobes, I'll risk everything
Sheesh, bitch I'm back up on that street shit
You don't rap, you just sneak diss
Tryna knock one of your peoples
I came in with the deep dish
You only tough on the weekends
That's twenty thou on the deep end
We'll have him singin' like The Weeknd
The Ruler, I don't like to sneak diss, cut it with all that cheap shit
Like do you know what a mink is, like do you know what a chink is
Just a silly lil beaver, I'm with my dread head heathens
My niggas bullying demons, we spitting fullies out of Beamers
Might wanna fuck but I don't need her
In fact I really need Jesus
Bruh whats up with your people?
Niggas ain't looking like they eating
In fact you really need to feed 'em
The Stinc Team Big Meechin'
I tried to tell you all bleeders
My wrist broke, I need a breather
I'm Mr. Everything
Got a drum, got a beam, I got pills, I got dough, I got lean
Bitch I bought everything
Niggas trippin' in the club, so what
I ain't really tryna scuff, I let off everything
Niggas lyin' in they raps, that's a fact
Who these pussy niggas jack, my image is everything
From the gold, from the watch
From the stove to my frozen earlobes, I'll risk everythingI take time to make that 
Some breakdowns get caked back 
Flip eight times, get eight stacks 
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right 
There's no need to stash right 
Same four G's from last night 
You cannot take that from me
Hey yo I'm movin' on up, excuse a moi, pardon it's me
There's a new chapter to life that I'm starting to see
And I'ma make and spend money to the hardest degree
And on the low I probably mimic every artist I see
I need a house, a wifey, a nice watch and a lot of cake
I can't lie, there's certain figures I gotta make
And for my family, this a shot that I gotta take
Cause where I live there's nobody as hot as Drake
Which basically means, who's faith in his team
Will resort to new cars, briefcases with cream
Tryna find a space in the jeans for placing the green
And a watch get they attention, the bracelet's clean
I'm stayin' the music, wifey kinda need to be a band lover
I keep it flow, an old school like your grandmother
I'm a tan brother, they use rubber bands to keep his money intact, if you don't like it you should ban rubber
I take time to make that 
Some breakdowns get caked back 
Flip eight times, get eight stacks 
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right 
There's no need to stash right 
Same four G's from last night 
You cannot take that from me
These days I really can't break 20s, hunnid and make money, money
Every month, the government will take money from me
Make 750, look how quicky I spent that, don't call me broke cause I strictly  resent that
Last my P had to flip my the rent, because the tax bracket I'm in's is 50 percent flat
All because of Ebay givin' me leway, basically do the PayPal, I need a raise now
Seems every time a nigga stop and he eat, I end up always tryna shop and compete
They know a nigga 'bout it when it's in his size and cops it in more colors than Popsicle Pete
Till I'm piled to the top with receipts, trust the store and I don't understand less is more
Wanna get 'em to the point where they owe me, and they gon' see Drake's on his JOB, it's like...
I take time to make that 
Some breakdowns get caked back 
Flip eight times, get eight stacks 
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right
There's no need to stash right
Same four G's from last night
You cannot take that from meI know you
I care too
I see through
All of the pictures that you keep on the wall
All of the people that will come to the ball
But hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride
Hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride
I know, too
What you do
When you're through
Counting the cattle as they go by the door
Keeping the carpet that's so thick on the floor
But hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride
Hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride
I know you
I care too
I see through
All of the pictures that you keep on the wall
All of the people that will come to the ball
But hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride?
Hear me calling
Won't you give me
A free ride?Cold devil, I'ma do these niggas hella foul
Dick hanging out in public, I'm a pedophile
The type of shells that'll knock down juggernaut
Boom boom boom, he was shocked when the hundred dropped
Ain't with the squabbling, you finna get your celly popped
And I can sense all the hatred and the animosity
Up out the mud through katanas and Benihanas
Make the money doing flips 'til it's Benihanas
I'm a grouch and a motherfuckin' cookie monster
Where the safe? where the grams? nigga spit it out
Duct tape and a mask, we gon' get it out you
Let him live what your family gon' be yellin' out
Red tape, yellow tape when I'm out of bounds
Everything cool until we running in your house
I'm in love with ling ling but I got a bopper
And besides Mae Ling finna take me shopping
Red tape, yellow tape when I'm out of bounds
Everything cool until we running in your house
I'm in love with ling ling but I got a bopper
And besides Maylene finna take me shopping
Cool devil, I'm a hooligan
Tired of niggas and his goofy ass jewelry
Take that shit to Pablo for that buffoonery
F&N shells for niggas like Booker T
Silly niggas always talking 'bout booking me
I think he mad 'cause he's lost and always will be
Last supper, I can tell by your earrings
And them bummy ass clothes you be wearing
When you see me up in traffic we ain't staring
I hope your car bulletproof, you gon' be stranded
Mr. Mosley, all I wanted was the ransom
Half a mil in the duffel bag, just flash it
Red tape, yellow tape when I'm out of bounds
Everything cool until we running in your house
I'm in love with ling ling but I got a bopper
And besides Maylene finna take me shopping
Red tape, yellow tape when I'm out of bounds
Everything cool until we running in your house
I'm in love with ling ling but I got a bopper
And besides Maylene finna take me shopping
Like, keep my name out your mouth. Nigga we all know y'all tired of me talkin' shit at the end of these songs but just keep my name out your mouth, you won't have to hear from me no more. Sike, bitch I'ma still keep talking shit, the fuck is you talking 'bout? This shit reckless nigga, 'til we running your house. Had to bring Longstocking out, bitch. Free everybody though. This tape gon' hurt niggas' feelingsAt least I'm honest
Spread your love like a wildfire
When I breathe you in I go up and smoke
You fill my lungs and it gets me higher
Why do I have to let you go?
See the truth is gonna hurt
But that only makes it worse
Oh-oh

Not saying I'm perfect
For whatever it's worth

Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back and forth faxes

Nebby Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest

What up Nikko, Jordan, Lucky and TJ nicknamed the Night Fox clique we take it easy
You Prime Ministers claim you repping the T, I need a Motherfucking president to represent me niggaUh, It's 10 O'Clock on a Wednesday and I know your home 
Driving up and down your street hoping you that come outside 
Cause I just got paid and I'm winning bout to call you on it

Selfish says it is, this just ain’t bout you, no

I could have made it all on my own"]
Ya no es amor lo que busca la gente
Pero sé que tú y yo vamos a ver lo que se siente
Porque al poner mi mano en tu piel
La temperatura sube a otro nivel
Y vamos a querer tratarnos diferente
Y no nos tenemos que apresurar
Podemos detener el tiempo y mucho más
Si quieres déjate llevar
Que no soy como los demás
Corazón, es el momento de enamorarnos a fuego lento
Y amor, tu movimiento hace que arda y me queme por dentro
Corazón, es el momento de enamorarnos a fuego lento
Y amor, tu movimiento hace que arda y me queme por dentro
Lento, a fuego
A fuego, lento
A fuego
No, don't blow out the fire
Quiero probar cada detalle de tu boca
Y poderte llevar a lugares que provocan
Amanecer contigo mujer pero de noche en tus brazos volver
Y la verdad eso te vuelve loca
Y no nos tenemos que apresurar
Podemos detener el tiempo y mucho más
Si quieres déjate llevar
Que no soy como los demás
Corazón, es el momento de enamorarnos a fuego lento
Y amor, tu movimiento hace que arda y me queme por dentro

Stop the violence, how when every blind is like the motherfucking Watts riots pouring out my pen
Alright then be easy I'm a get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics but I can't leave the crib without some Xanax in my water... 
Hello my name is Travie and I'm a lifeaholic
Told'em all these beats is like the Wallace to my Gromitt... 
The alpha to my Bruce Wayne, stripes on my candy cane
Worn without the other so for real without the candy brain
Super trooper like a gun tote in candyman
Ask me how I'm living bet I tell ya fine and dandy man
Check his vital signs they peaking off the meter man
Imma live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
Fuck pulling the nine out

Sipping Purple Rain with Mary Jane girls in my house...

If the things that I seen through my Prada frames got me paid
Watch me man, I'm cocky slave with this Rocky chain

And this name of it is fame and it's all up in my blood
Trying to suppress the too fresh feeling I got... Oooh yes
I'm aiming for the hugest duplex living like I'm Hugh Heff'
Every other night I need a brunette for group sex
Leaving with a bruised neck then I yell whose next... 
Stand'em in a line this is new fact city take this crack between ya thighs... 
 I'm promethazine fuck the queen
Sniff the white horse of success and then let him lean... 
Trying to match my high on life... 
Gotta catch the spot on my flight
First class known of the aroma of the smoker life
Got me like a stoner, a zoner but nah it's never over... 
I stick my tongue out, sipping Remy conceited of I'm teasing every bum out
Hung out with celebrities from every drug house
So when you remember me say that I was strung out...

Nothing worked out
In the way that you planned
Nothing was quite as you thought
Try very hard not to misunderstand
Joy as it flies cannot be caught
Poor mum, Poor mum
Where did you take a wrong turning?
Poor mum, poor mum
Pack up that last little yearning
Pack it away with the books and the toys
Silent and dumb
Silent and mum
Go out and grab at your life
And forget
You are poor, poor...
"Mum"I'm tired of all your excuses
I'm tired of all your lies
Your filthy schemes and abuses
Ooh, I've finally grown wise
Got tired of chasin' it down
Baby, it's better that I'm not around
And I'm on the highway to nowhere
Tryin' to get by without you
I don't know why it took me so long to
Wind up back at nowhere with you, oh
Wind up back at nowhere with you
Wind up back at nowhere
Wind up back at nowhere with you
It's time for a little payback
It's time for a little respect
You can't just rewind and playback
All of the shit that you wrecked
And I'm on the highway to nowhere
Tryin' to get by without you
I don't know why it took me so long to
Wind up back at nowhere with you, oh
Wind up back at nowhere with you
Wind up back at nowhere
Wind up back at nowhere with you
And I'm on the highway to nowhere
Tryin' to get by without you

Let's go home
We are awesome
We are awesomeSheesh, everything I state is facts
I'm not these other street niggas, bitch I can really rap
I'm ridin' round town with a tommy gun and a Jag
And you can disregard the yelling, RJ tied up in the back
Man stop playing, pour that eight up in a Masi
I'm driving so fast, my eyes look like I'm crying
Of course my wrist shining, don't ask me what these are
Bitch these are VVS Diamonds, it's hard to see the timing
And if I take a look for myself it might blind me
He the type of nigga put slashes in his eyebrows
Pigtail flat tops? please, tell me what's that 'bout
One thing about Drakeo, no, I don't tap out
Bay Bay kids, running around eleven years old with the MAC out
You think I'm Yo Gotti the way I just brought this sack out
Say I pour too much, that's the type of shit I laugh 'bout
This a three band pint, I guess I had to bring the Act out
And since everybody eatin' let's see Splack bring a bag out
That's a fit and some strings, put a wig in a Lyft
Send a bitch to the retreat, tell that bitch bring my ends
Put the draco down, the engineer scared, so what, he ear hustlin'
Do 'em so cold, I will, the fit been mustard
Disgusting, suck me, fuck me, you bitches love me
You frown, you clown, you match, you must be crusty
I'm psycho, Michael Myers, I might just gut him
I'm in this shit to win, ain't no fuckin' bein' humble
It's a dog eat dog world but ain't no poodles in the jungle
It's 2016, we ain't 'bout to Royal Rumble
Almost lost my balance and grabbed the K 'fore I stumbled
What you say? speak up bitch, I can't hear you when you mumble
He yellin' too much on his track, get him a muzzle
Thirty-two, what if rap don't work? he ain't got no hustle
Watch worth twenty-five, where was you at twenty-five?
Pimps me, diss me, silly, I know you miss me
This a see-through drum with death darts and it's fifty
Niggas grown ass men, how you ain't ever seen fifty?
Niggas talkin' that tough shit, always end with just kidding
Bye bye bleed 'em, who brought you the Stinc meaner

I'm from 2 Greedy family, what I look like rap beefin'?
Shootin' K's on Naomi, police like that's black people
Puttin' money on my watch, what the fuck these niggas thinkin'?
How I'm supposed to get in heaven, I just fist fought with Jesus
Finna wash down my sins with a pint of MG-Peezy
Times three percocets, how the fuck I'm 'posed to think straight?
Niggas wanna rap beef but niggas ain't ever seen cake
Talkin' 'bout they want me, I just left MCJ
The whole shebang, I'm the closest thing to it
In the Masi thing, I traumatized the doors
You can tell I'm high, it's coming out my pores
Give me pints on pints on pints on pints, I'm scorched
The Nike sign is outlined on my 'ports
Twelve years old when I jumped off the porch
Central LP sim, what was you doin'?
Shit, clearly I wasn't into books
I was ridin' 'round town with flat heads and crooks
Lay a Drakeo on the rap game, please, these niggas shook

We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that

'Cause even when I got it, I just gotta keep getting it
Even when I got it, I just gotta keep getting it
Big hotel suite, I'm the only one in it
Always going back to some shit that I already been it
Plenty fish up in the sea but I never go fishing
We got everybody sick, sending "get well soons" and a lot of well wishes
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go

Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than...
Yeah, yeahI am grateful to be able to call America my second home. Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened, emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something.
It's impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues.
This is real and I'm concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends, and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step.
My thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence.
Be safe out there. More life.Let go, let's go, shawty, let go
Yeah, we seein' bread, we gettin' bankrolls
At the W, fuck the layover
She only twenty-one, but her money way older
So let go, let's go, shawty, let's go
Yeah, we seein' bread, we gettin' bankrolls
At the W, fuck the layover
Run this shit up and remain focused
Let's go, lit like the stoves, get dough
Let's roll, break it down, let's leave
Wintertime, fall pass, that mean it's less leaves
Harvest season, boot season, nigga, whatever
I just had to go with a reason to rock expensive sweaters
Choose your weapons, Gucci leather, ridin' to Cold Devil
You know this Draco heavy, thousand dollar tools, thousand dollar shoes
Drakeo and Bambino got Margielas, that's 03 different blues
03 got some different views
Just purchased a condo in the South 'cause I had deja vu
Birdhouses, bird brain, I had a different youth
Been flew out the nest, wind in my chest, I had to make the news
Let's go, my mama used to pray for this in pews
Churches full of liars, I be preachin' in my interviews
Street nigga testimony, pop you if you test the homie
I just read on Malcolm X, By Any Means Necessary
And I felt the Holy Ghost inside my yard
I want the Wraith, so I'ma kill the booth
Million dollar deal, gave my mom a chill
Gave my daughter gifts, thought I wasn't here
Almost shed a tear, glad I kept it real, 03
Let go, let's go, shawty, let go
Yeah, we seein' bread, we gettin' bankrolls
At the W, fuck the layover
She only twenty-one, but her money way older
So let go, let's go, shawty, let's go
Yeah, we seein' bread, we gettin' bankrolls
At the W, fuck the layover
Run this shit up and remain focused
Me and Maylene battling for custody, I can't let go
You know my Ruler drastic, I'm a nutso, klepto
An acronym, an F&N is on me, I'ma let go
Roll bounce on my neck, got VS on my set stone
Do these niggas dead wrong, shells rip through teflon
Picasso, paint a picture and it's vivid on my Margielas
Nigga, pay attention, the olympics, brought my gold medals
Lyin' ass nigga, know Geppetto is your songwriter

It's gon' be a long night, disco ball, strobe lights
.223's, Bron and Mike, 03 just got out tonight
Free my nigga Ketchy and free Kel, bustin' niggas' eyes
Spendin' so much money on my pieces, make a nigga cry
Bin Laden when I ride, I'm off a twelve, you see my eyes
When opening the newspaper, only time I see my opps
Free my guys and free your wife, if niggas wanna beef, aight
Aiming if he in my space tellin' me Twitter lies
Niggas thought they gave me life, ridin' in the spaceship like
Geesy wanna take a ride, niggas wanna take my life
Star Wars laser fight, Drakeo like to play with life, ughAre you putting in your songs?
No, I'm not when you ask
Nope
Kind of, I guess
Hollywood girl
Is lost again
All of her hopes left her stranded
Seasoned dreams
Are just pretend
She can't stand it
Why'd it have to happen to me?
Why'd it have to hurt so bad?
'Cause in this town
Can't find up, but I found down
In the city life
Can't turn around
Can't give up I feel too proud
Under the city lights
She doesn't believe
In believing
Miracles have died in her mind
She knows the world
Is deceiving
Everything is wastin' her time
Why'd it have to happen to me?
Why'd it have to hurt so bad?
'Cause in this town
Can't find up, but I found down
In the city life
Can't turn around
Can't give up I feel too proud
Under the city lights
Get in line and hold your head high
Pretty face will help you get by
Step inside I'll make your tears dry
So put on your smile
Ha
'Cause in this town
Can't find up, but I found down
In the city life
Can't turn around
I can't give up I feel too proud
Under the city lights
One of the drivers has to pick you up at the airport
And bring you to my photo shoot so I can see you
I'm so sorry, I tried to get it changed
I'm so sorry, baby
Don't be madAhh-ah-ah-ahh-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ah
Fingers movin' in a certain pattern
Strings with notes to hammer out the beat
Get a pen and a piece of paper
Get a load of that mahogany
Making eyes and making guitar lines
Anticipation building all that's good
You can almost hear the notes just fallin'
Reverberating through that old rosewood
Kinda like just swinging without music
Kinda like we're dancin' in the breeze
Kinda want to stay here forever
Kinda like a big redwood tree
Kinda like just swinging without music
Kinda like we're dancin' in the breeze
Kinda want to stay here forever
Kinda like a big redwood tree
Fallin' n' callin', fallin' callin' forever
We're like a song that ends in major key
I know we said the words inside our mind
It doesn't become reality
Kinda like just swinging without music
Kinda like we're dancin' in the breeze
Kinda want to stay here forever
Kinda like a big redwood tree
Kinda like just swinging without music 
Kinda like we're dancin' in the breeze 
Kinda want to stay here forever 
Kinda like a big redwood tree
Kinda like just swinging without music
Kinda like we're dancin' in the breeze
Kinda want to stay here forever
Kinda like a big redwood tree
Kinda like just swinging without music
Kinda like we're dancin' in the breeze
Kinda want to stay here forever
Kinda like a big redwood treeRight Honourable,
This bearer came aboard the ship I was in in a wonderful good time and brought with him as good knowledge as we would wish, his surefulness therein is worthy recompense, for that god hath given us so good a day in forcing the enemy so far to leeward, as I hope in God the Prince of Parma and the Duke of Sidonia shall not shake hands this few days. And upon so ever they shall meet, I believe neither of them will greatly rejoice of this day's service. The town of Callys hath seen some part thereof, whose mayor Her Majesty is beholding unto. Business commands me to end. God bless Her Majesty our gracious sovereign and give us all grace to live in his favour. I assure your Honour this day's service hath much appalled the enemy, and no doubt has encouraged our army. From aboard her Majesty's good ship the Revenge, this 29th July 1588.
                                          Your Honour's most
                                          ready to be commanded,
                                          Francis Drake.
There must be great care taken to send us munition and victual wither so ever the enemy goeth. Yours, Fra. Drake.Uh, shit's all good

Drug dealers live vicariously through me

A couple makes what could melt the snow
Making fun of me
A single look never cut me so
And I know
To save the conversation
And I know
A deeper contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me if I could fool the world
Walk away from me
I see the change in the atmosphere
What a way to be
To turn the page
Just to make it clear
And I know
To change the conversation
And I know
A deeper contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me if I could fool the world
To fear
Or to disappear
What a waste a time
What a troubled mind
A fortune find for another day
As you're passing by
You look behind to see what I would say
And I know
To change the conversation
And I know
A deeper contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me
So I go
To change the conversation
I know
A deep contemplation
Is all I need to make believe
Everyone would love me
If I could fool
The world
I can't survive another day in the life
Without a day in the sun
Before you touch me
Here's a word of advice
If I were you I would
Come get it
Come get it
Come get it
So won't you tell me why
That every corner of my head is a home
But every fool is the same
It would be tragic if you left me alone
But left me no one to blame
Well don't it make you wonder what got us here
The covers that were under could disappear
Promises keep us in chains my dear
(if I could fool the world
Then no one would know where I've been)
What am I feelingAll that dick riding’ll get a nigga flipped
Princess cuts on my wrist like an emo bitch
Done mud walked in Neimans twice, I don't need no help
This forty bulging on my hip, I don't need no belt
Luke Skywalkin', pints caulkin', I'm an addict
Come get slippy with the knock knock bandits
The Stinc man will come supply my Grammys
I guess that's a double whammy

Responsible for everything you listen to, a mediocre talent, let me see if I can condition you
Took over my city, and I never asked permission to
Started poppin' bottles, cause it's ATL tradition to
Celebrate with Bob Ma, fuck him at the So-ho
If there ain't an elevator in it, it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin', and these bitches wanna snow blow
And they just give me head, while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ should've won that
Listen and respect, man, the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, halla at me when you're done laps
Roll around with Neego, Party with Azooka
Shout goes out to 1Da, shout goes out to Future
Shout goes out to Getti, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch, just can't seem to hold it steady
'Cause I see the flame flickering, x girls bickering
Got these women jockin' me from Holly Grove all the way to Picker Ring
I tryed to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan, but my connect said it'd take a minute if you listening

Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody, even if you suin' me

Just halla if you got me, fuck you if you had me
Shout goes out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver, and 40, man, you know the deal

And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings

We the 2 Greedy Stinc TeamIf I could have a single wish
I'd only wish I'd never miss it when you wake up and smile
It makes me happy when you steal a little kiss
Before you wake me up to listen to the news for a while
And when you're creeping outta bed
I sneak a peak to see just what you were wearing last night
What was left of ripping off your clothes
I checked to see the door was closed as you were turning off the light
Who ever said romance was over
Roll over
So I can show you
Don't you want me to be the captain of your submarine up periscope
That's what I say
That's just my way
Of saying that I love you
My life is like a bowl of cherries
Not so very ordinary, overflowing with love
And I could never want four more unless our two becomes a four
Or maybe three if we practice it enough
Who ever said romance was over
Roll over
So I can show you
Don't you want me to be the captain of your submarine up periscope
That's what I say
That's just my way
Of saying that I love you
Well I know that life is hard
I know that love can break your heart
That's just the way that it is
Well baby, that's a load of smack
And don't you know I've got your back and what's important is the way that we live
And like the way you love this song
Because it makes you hum along and tap your foot to the beat
That's the way you make me feel
When we're doing it for real
I can feel it from my head to my feet
Who ever said romance was over
Roll over
So I can give you
One more chance to believe
And hopefully see
That I still want you
Don't you want me to be the captain of your submarine
Up periscope
That's what I say
That's just my way
Of saying that I love youTalkin' to God but yet the devil in the red
Drink so hard it's kinda hard to steer the wheel
Bitch chill, I know they're behind me
I hang my wrist out the window, shit it just might blind 'em
Goin' ninety, but we be goin' to sixty
I threw the bitch in sports mode to get me out in a jiffy
So specific, they like Drakeo a menace
The head bobber, shit the Stinc Team has entered the building
Too poured, they say I'm out of control
This pointer cost thirty and it ain't even gold
Don't talk bold, 'cause you know billy be trippin'
And did I mention Maison Jeter just entered the building?
I mean I'm gangster, but you should already notice
Nickname me the deep freezer 'cause my outfit the coldest
Don't try to clone it, shit I wouldn't condone it
We hit the strip thirty thick and start tossin' up boulders
Don't try to clone us, I don't condone it
We up out tossin' boulders, we could do this 'til the morning
Just to see who money longer, but shit I really don't condone it
Please don't try to clone us, I don't condone it
We up out tossin' boulders, we could do this 'til the morning
Just to see who money longer, but shit I really don't condone it
Please don't try this at home, I don't condone it
Please don't try this at home, I don't condone it
Since fifteen I been ridin' around gettin' it
Lookin' up to the druglords, gettin' letters from prisoners
Focused, I'm on a mission, I'm only chasing these benjis
These niggas, they can't offend me, don't care if niggas befriend me
My nigga I need a milly, got dreams of rollin' in Bentleys
That forty bulging on Timmy, I'm shootin' it 'til it's empty
Them shots is louder than hemis, I'm hungry, I'm eatin' Benis
See Timmy with 2 Greedy, I need it, I'm too needy
Blue benjis at new Chilis, stop hatin', the crew with me
Try somethin', got tools with me, I'm smokin', got kush on me
I'm smellin' like kush only, don't need it but lean on me
I'm pourin' the fours only, yeah please don't try to
Don't try to clone us, I don't condone it

Just to see who money longer, but shit I really don't condone it
Please don't try to clone us, I don't condone it

Only the wind in the long green grass
The frost in a broken tree
I was made to love magic
All its wonder to know
But you all lost that magic
Many many years ago
I was born to use my eyes
Dream with the sun and the skies
To float away in a lifelong song
In the mist where melody flies
I was made to love magic
All its wonder to know
But you all lost that magic
Many many years ago
I was born to sail away
Into a land of forever
Not to be tied to an old stone grave
In your land of never
I was made to love magic
All its wonder to know
But you all lost that magic

No one to love me
Only the wind in the long green grass
The frost in a broken tree
I was made to love magic
All its wonder to know
But you all lost that magic
Many many years ago
I was born to use my eyes
Dream with the sun and the skies
To float away in a lifelong song
In the mist where melody flies
I was made to love magic
All its wonder to know
But you all lost that magic
Many many years ago
I was born to sail away
Into a land of forever
Not to be tied to an old stone grave
In your land of never
I was made to love magic
All its wonder to know
But you all lost that magic

Alright, this is it right? We are rolling and we're recording, let's begin. This is a very special broadcast of OVO Sound Radio right here, Beats 1, Apple Music.  Long time coming man.  Long time coming man...long time coming, an exciting time, an exciting night for obvious reasons. Any way, man, here we are in the Safe House this is kind of...I suppose the official home of OVO Sound, this is the heart now of OVO Sound, here in Toronto, OVO house based in Toronto. Uhm...It's 40's spot, where the music gets made.
40's...uh  what do they call it, like a brain child, brain child? This is 40's creation from the ground up...I mean I was here, man, when there were no walls. I was here when there was no...not even a hint of a studio, or any...and uhm, he saw it through to the end. I mean, incredible execution on a vision that he had from the very...very early on. I know he's always...he's always enjoyed living in the same space that he works in. So he's been able to build this...build this complex that we utilize to get the job done, yeah.
When you walked in here for this first time, because I always thinking like....rooms you can catch a vibe pretty quick Yeah  And you know 40 obviously build this, you were there for the process...and when, you know, he called you in for the first session...did you, did you catch a vibe? Did you record something that first night?
I was here, uhm, I was here a few times as you know...I was here when this room first started functioning and everything else wasn't built. I think....I think maybe the first...one of the first things we did here that got released was probably "Back to Back" ironically enough, but I think that was kinda when we were kind of....That's how you, uh, that's how you broke the bottle on the bow? Haha that was like one of the first...  On that track? That was like one of the first thingsWow.  that we actually recorded and it...and it...Tangible energy from the get-go.
I mean, you know, just...  Get it done. execution, man, just following suit. I watched 40 execute so I had to come in here and execute too, that's it.  How many visitors really...I mean I know there's a lot of people in here tonight for obvious reasons, because, you know, we're tryna capture something. You know...but, uhm, you know, when it's, when it's... business time, how many...how many visitors generally roll through here? Cause the vibe I get is you guys keep it pretty...pretty light.
Yeah, I don't really. I'm not really into, like, a whole bunch of people and distraction, uhm...I have, you know, I have respect for everybody and their craft in whatever they do. So I expect the same thing when people come in here, I don't want a bunch of hustle and bustle, talking and...loud you know. And...and the other thing that's tough when you invite people in the studio...is they're obviously coming to watch something happen. Right.
And...and it doesn't always happen every night.  You know...it's not like every night is some magic moment. I mean, there's nights of frustration, there's nights of nothingness, there's night of just...you know, uh...these little tactical, uh, things. That clinical, surgical edits and stuff that...it gets you know Housekeeping. Right. I pretty much gauge the, uhm... characters that are allowed to sit in here based off of how they conduct themselves on those type of nights.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I think I have a pretty immediate, immediate team that is able to sit in here and I...I...I...I don't want to notice you, and that's not to be offensive,  I just don't want to know that you're here. I want to be able to...to get up and just go in there and spill you know. Not worry about people's feelings Yeah. or tensions or any of that, that makes perfect sense, you know. Today unless...you change your mind Laughing  the album's done It's done. 40 sent it while the game was on. It's crazy, I mean we're literally watching the Raptors while 40 was...you know... Mhm.  I think the line was  from Noel was "right now we've been finished for seven seconds." Yeah hahahahaha.
Vincent like came in, he was like "but nah, I sent the...I sent the email seven minutes ago, we've been finished for seven minutes." And he want to his computer and he was like "ah, I never sent it."  The game clock was kinda measuring the album clock too you know, it's synonymous tonight. Oh man the world clock has been measuring the album now...and, and to a certain extent that's your fault. Cause back on August the 6th in 2014 you announced the name of the record. Yeah.
Now...now I have...I spoke to your friend Skepta about announcing records prematurely.  Mhm. And he was pretty straight about it, he wish he hadn't done it. He felt the pressure of announcing Konichiwa way up front, added additional pressure to him. I mean...you did it almost two years before you delivered the record. How did it work for you making that announcement, you know... in 2014?
I think the...the announcement was more than just the album title, it was just a shift in the city. You know, that we, uh...we saw an opening there. You know, it was, it was, the name took on a life of it's own. Uhm...and now the city is obviously referred to as, as what it is...Yeah.  Uhm...and yeah, I mean...I...we're...me and Oliver are always, are very cautious about that. Uh...we never wanna prematurely announce anything, but I kinda feel like, like it's crazy that you say two years cause t really doesn't feel like two years. I mean, yeah, I just had this plan to finish this album and then...but I, I remember I was like "oh man, well you know, I'm gonna do a mixtape."
Just cause I'm just like at this place, where I'm..I'm in this hotel every night, I just wanna make rap music, and I always, always wanted to make a, a project with Boi-1da. Uh...just like, exclusively like his... his brand of music, like just hard ish, like uh...trying to snap as much as I could and get as many joints as I could in, in a short amount of time. Uhm...and so that's kind of, you know, I was really adamant about finishing that mixtape first and then I said, okay then I'll move on. I mean, when we...when we do these albums, and especially if it's me and 40...it's never not been me and 40...but, when me and 40 lock in.  We really lock in  ...yeah.  and we take it very seriously and it's not... it's not like some rush job, you know? We...we, we'll sit there and, and we...like I said some nights we don't even come here and make music some nights we just talk yeah... we talk and we listen and you know, we try and figure out, what...what the direction is and what...what works for me...  It seems to me,  that might be a distinction because you blur the lines so successfully, it helps in the evolution of mixtapes. They've been around in existence for a long time and yet when you started to do and some of your peers started to do it at a similar time, these mixtapes were becoming blockbusters in their own right. They weren't just moving the streets anymore, they were actually moving the sales and the charts and you were touring off the back of these things.
Well, well that was it, I went...I wnt on a full-blown tour off of If You're Reading This It's Too Late....  It's crazy. ...and it went straight to iTunes  and I feel like that's like a...that's a hundred percent a possibility, same thing we do with a lot of the OVO Sound artists, you know, it's like, why not? You put all this time  and they're all original sounds, why should shouldn't it be able to be...you know, I understand, I understand...the...the joy of getting a free body of work from somebody, but you know, this is like one of the only platforms we have left to like generate interest and income and all these, you know, these...get the attention and make it that easy to access... and focus... as opposed to going to ten different places to try and find it once links are being you know...so I mean...  It's focusing your audience, isn't it  ultimately?  Yeah and that's really what it's about right now, is, is...and that's, I mean not to shamelessly plug but even...you know, what we've been doing with Apple Music and stuff like that...it's like you know, just focusing the audience and giving them a place to go and hone in on this one hub to go get everything.
Uhm...but with that being said, you know, I...I finished that tape and I was really happy with it a lot of the songs got bigger than expected and we had to go do some shows... I wondered that...I wondered, you know, if it...I mean I know you dropped it in the early hours in the morning and it was just like "Wake up surprise, here's a Drake record" and everything else, but i know how I felt about that album and millions of other people do as well and that record has become, in many respects, a modern-day classic...and I wondered if that caught you off guard?
Uhm...yeah I definitely...I definitely always just treated it like a mixtape. I...I was never...you know, even the difference between this album and that is like...the...the time we spent on the transitions, the layering of the production, the...the changes...just, just...sonically even, the time that 40 and Gadget put in...uhm, you know...this was just a tape that we did in my hotel room at the end of the day...Laughing so, I mean, it's...it's great that people love it, I mean, I always just looked at it as a bridge to get to where we're...we're at today. And then...and then from that, I mean, I ended up going to Atlanta and sitting with Future for six days and he's just a...  a monster  ...he's a machine, it's crazy, I've never seen anybody with that much of a catalog...like I mean, songs that I still think about to this day that I heard in that studio, that I'm like "when is that coming out?"
Oh, I've seen him...I've seen people loading projectsCan't think of any other songs to do
What could I do, what would be interesting
Gold and silver is the autumn
Soft and tender are her skies
Yes and no are the answers
Written in my true love's eyes
Autumn's leaving and winter's coming
I think that I'll be moving along
I've got to leave her and find another
I've got to sing my heart's true song
Round and round the burning circle
All the seasons: one, two, and three
Autumn leaves and then there winter
Spring is born and wanders free
Gold and silver burns my autumns
All too soon they'd fade and die
And then I'd know, there'd be no others
Milk and honey were their liesWest Coast lost, only you and me, no one knowing 'bout us
Following the white lines, I see it in my headlights, not another car in sight
Endless trust, even everything even we knew in the dust
Gonna let it low, don't know where we're goin', this is where the rubber meets the road
Sometimes we don't need to run, we don't need to hide
Don't need to take our time when it's on our side, livin' life by the minute
Wild cards, this takes the road, it all when we move the dice
Never said it back but we paid the price of one more minute
Let's run away, step back from the city
Escape and no one else will have to wait
And we'll sing, oh-oh-oh...
Let's run away, oh, let's run away
Broke down car, little pocket change didn't get us too far
Stranded on the highway, fillin' up the ashtray, maybe this is where we need to stay
We're in start, a little city made from broken parts
Just you and me, we could be free, baby
Sometimes we don't need to run, we don't need to hide
Don't even need to take our time when it's on our side, livin' life by the minute
Wild cards, this takes the road, it all when we move the dice
Never said it back but we paid the price of one more minute
Let's run away, step back from the city
Escape and no one else will have to wait
And we'll sing, oh-oh-oh...
Let's run away, oh, let's run away
Let's run away, step back from the city
Escape and no one else will have to wait
And we'll sing, oh-oh-oh...
Let's run away, oh, let's run awayOh it's like that yeah it's like this
Don't take the shot 'cause you might miss
But I risk it all just to get it all
And check the watch on my wrist
It say my time do it prime time
I'm always working on my lines
I got a fear of failure but I know it's all in my mind
Ain't about plays, it's about quality
Every day people follow me
Roll the dice, bet it all on me
She loves how I spit, why she swallows me
Yeah, I mean it like that
Style and sound never seen it like that
Switch up the flow then I bring it right back
And I'm balling old school I Kareem it like that, uh
Yeah, thats how we go
They don't get the reference 'cause it's different to know, ah yeah yeah
Man, but life ain't that bad
I see you out here hating and I know why you mad it's 'cause
Do you realize I got
Everything that you want, bitch I'm chosen
See me light up the spot
Got my name on your clock glad you notice
That I love what I do
I won't need protection 'cause I ain't ever gon' lose, oh yeah yeah
And they can stand to the side
I won't hide my passion 'cause no ones ever getting mine, oh oh
Never say I'm worthless
No, never say I'm worthless
Can't put me in a box, just put me in a frame thats perfect
Is this all we want, is this all we need?
Screw fame I'ma give right back to the people giving back to me
Everyone wants fame, but can't put in the time am I wrong
People I grew up admiring want me on songs
It's just going to show me that every night I stayed in really payed off
Skipped out on college for this so they say I got balls
Always had passion to do what they said that I can't
Yeah I'm the man, yeah I'm the man
Always a part of my plan
Thanking my blueprint I made at fourteen
19 right now finally getting some green
Never chase women I'm chasing my dreams
And I'm reppin the noise putting on for my team
Squad
Do you realize I got
Everything that you want, bitch I'm chosen
See me light up the spot
Got my name on your clock glad you notice
That I love what I do
I won't need protection 'cause I ain't ever gon' lose, oh yeah yeah
And they can stand to the side
I won't hide my passion 'cause no one's ever getting mine, oh oh
Do you realise I got
Everything that you want, bitch I'm chosen
See me light up the spot
Got my name on your clock glad you notice
Yeah, let me tell you something you didn't know
I'm the same kid with a different flow
And I can speed it fast or I can take it slow
Trying to get that white cheese I'm talking mozzarella
Put it in the bank what I tell the bank teller
Man I'm so damn clever with a talent couldn't measure
I do it better with every letter like it's whatever
Yeah, they love how I spit it, oh
Talk about do it while I did it
Talk about life while I live it
Man you're so damn jealous bro but yeah I get it
Not everybody has the skill to rap
Just look at how I killed the track
They should call me Hillary 'cause I don't know where my Bills are at
Dammit I'm broke
But dammit I'm dope
And I could take any line and turn that shit to your girl's favorite quote
Don't know how I do it
I just know that I do
I'ma do me
And you can do you
Oh yeah it's like thatBird flew by
And wondered, wondered why
She was wise enough to stay up in the sky
From the air she could wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season
Your life flies away
As the night turns to day
If you stop once to think
Your hair will soon turn grey
But one would like to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season
The list of fallen stars
And crumbled, broken hearts
Comes from a need
To play so many parts
But one would like to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season
The wind and the rain
Shook hands again
Untouched by the world
They managed to keep sane
They were able to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season
Bird flew by
And wondered, wondered why
She was wise enough to stay up in the sky
From the air she could wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a seasonDrake has confirmed the title of his upcoming fourth studio album, Views From the 6, though he won't begin work on it until after he returns from his 31-city co-headlining tour with Lil Wayne. The tour, slated to start after the Canadian rapper's OVO Fest, will kick off August 8th in Darien Center, New York and run through September 27th, when it ends in Woodlands, Texas. That tour, which is sponsored by a video-game manufacturer, will feature a nightly competition between fans of the two rappers.
The meaning of the album title is unclear, but the announcement is just one part of what will be a busy summer for the rapper. On July 16th, Drake will host ESPN's ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, where the ceremony will be televised live at 9 p.m. EST on the sports channel. The show intends to celebrate the best moments in sports with music, comedy bits and appearances by famous athletes.
Later in the month, Drake's label OVO Sound will release two records by artists he signed. Majid Jordan will put out A Place Like This on July 22nd, and PARTYNEXTDOOR will release PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO on the 29th. Drake recently made a guest appearance on the latter artist's "Recognize," streaming below via Rap-Up, which will appear on the album.
Drake will then stage OVO Fest in Toronto on August 3rd and 4th, when Outkast will perform and he will do his own set, with appearances by yet-to-be-confirmed special guests. This year, OVO Fest was awarded a CAN $300,000 government grant, which amounts to roughly US $268,000, as part of an initiative to help out festivals in Ontario. A press release claims the festival has sold out of the fest's 35,000 tickets.Judging by my wrist, I couldn't tell you the time

It has taken a long time for him to get to this point. Do not get me wrong, he’s not perfect, but he has come a long way since my meeting with his mother. He has made improvement! So Aubrey, show these people what you got man!

Oh yeah!I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

You take my love for granted
I just don't understand itBlack days of winter all were through
The blossoms came and they brought you
Clouds left the sky and I knew the reason why
They made way for you and the blossom and the blossom
The seasons cycle turned again
An April shower now and then
Trees came alive, bees left their hive
They came out to see you and the blossom and the blossom
People were laughing, smiling with the sun
They knew that summer had begun
The days grew warm, the nights grew warm
Spring turned to summer and was gone
It seemed so fine, the cider and the wine
But I knew you'd go with the blossom with the blossom
When spring returns I'll look again
To find another blossom friend
Until I do, find something new
I'll just think of you and the blossom and the blossom
I'll just think of you and the blossomOoh
There's an old man playin' a flattop
On a handmade rocking chair
Oh god, it sounds so good
Yeah that feeling's there
You can hear the years, sweat and tears
Everythin' in between coming through them callous hands
Banging on them strings, it's in the heartbeat
It's in the heartbeat
It's in the real thing
You can't make it up
It's in your soul deep
It's in the stars, the stripes, this dirt on my feet
The way I love my woman & the way she loves me
It's in the heartbeat
Yeah, y'all put those hands together!
Ooh
Well, I lost my job at the power mill
To a man and his machine
But you can't replace these two hands with metal bolts and steam
So here's my plan, brother man, Yeah, I will be just fine
Cause I got my back, ain't got no slack, and this good ole spirit of mine
Roller Coaster, butterflies
Lowest lows or highest highs
Catch a little air on a jeep ride, Friday night
It's the game you lost, the game you won
The greatest thing you've ever done
And tell me, have you ever really loved someone?!
Cause when you love someone...
Yeah, when you love someone.... it's in your heartbeat
Yeah!Hey, yo, Drake, you never answer your goddamn phone, huh? Pick up the phone, man. I know they got you running around, bro. Anyway, it’s all good with Socrates hooking you up, dawg.

Yo, Drake. What up? This is Keeyaga, your boy here. Umm, I don’t know why you’re not picking up the phone, you’re probably out, you know, talking to Lindsay Lohan, or will be talking to her eventually. But, yo, check it out, it’s your boy Keeyaga. I’m just calling to say what up, haven’t talked to you in forever, indefinitely. You know, we need to go, you know, downtown Toronto, kick it together and do what we gotta do, but, uh, I gotta, you know, get off the phone because I have, you know, Beyoncé, you know, even Mendes all on the other line. So, yo, do what you gotta do, and holla at your boy man. All the best. PeaceOh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Embracing burning filament
A verbal avalanche
Is serving up your innocence
I said where'd you lose your mind
A brush with synergy
You came back all delirious
A Texas rance, a little dance
They'll take you serious
I said where'd you lose your mind
So you're on the rise
The wait is over
Hey there lucky one
I'm coming over
Well I would like to take some time
And tell you want I really want to say
And so my dear, it seems so clear
It wouldn't really matter anyway 
Standing in the bathroom
Reflections that you'd never get
Who'd have ever thought
That you would end up such a mess
I said where'd you lose your mind
But Amy, say you'll stay with me
Amy, say you'll stay with me
I'm all, I am all
Yes I'm all, I am all alone
So you're on the rise
The wait is over
Hey there lucky one
I'm coming over
Well I would like to take some time
And tell you want I really want to say
Say that I'm liking the company
More than your sympathy symphony
When I take what you give to me, it's easy
But the longer I wait for this moment to break me
I'm fine living a lie
Wondering why
Thinking it's over
Now what have I done
Maybe I just shouldn't have told her
To be
True          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        You know, this is pretty soft for me but
I think it was finally time for me to get it off my chest
Lately, I've been thinkin' 'bout the past
Thinkin 'bout my old girls and why it didn't last
Cuz she said "We'd be better as friends"
I think that's why it's hard for me to let new people in
Or maybe it's the fact that I'm so insecure
But I see someone different when I look in the mirror
I see a Drake, like the one who made "Take Care" and shit
But what's the success if you don't have someone to share with
Yeah, and girl I wanna share with ya
Yeah I had the vision, but you didn't see the picture
I was always shy, didn't think that I could get ya
Now I'm thinkin "Should I hit you up?" and tell ya that I missed you cuz
We never had sex, but we had a connection
Mama always told me boy to use protection
But she never warned me to go protect my heart
I guess that's why I should've known that it was doomed from the start like
Think about the good and bad
Think about the times we had
Oh I still think about you
Never meant to fall in love
Cuz the crazy things it does
Like I still think about you
Do you think about me too?
I won't lie, sometimes I still think about ya
Now the bottle's to myself and I just drink without ya
Remember New years, when you got so drunk
Off a couple shots, then you fell up in the bath tub?
That was ages ago, you probably don't remember
My heart's been gettin' colder like mid December
Peanut butter & jelly yeah we go better together
I even bought an umbrella to try to withstand the weather but
I guess it wasn't meant to be
I should've told you exactly what you meant to me
Reminisce on that high school dance
I think I could've been the one if you'd given me the chance but
I was just a fallback, there was always other guys
When I was around you, always got them butterflies
Hear you got a new man, aw yea that's good for you
I hope he makes you happy, I hope that he's good to you
Think about the good and bad
Think about the times we had
Oh I still think about you
Never meant to fall in love
Cuz the crazy things it does
Like I still think about you
Think about the good and bad
Think about the times we had
Oh I still think about you
Never meant to fall in love
Cuz the crazy things it does
Like I still think about you
Do you think about me too?Summer was gone and the heat died down
And Autumn reached for her golden crown
I looked behind as I heard a sigh
But this was the time of no reply
The sun went down and the crowd went home
I was left by the roadside all alone
I turned to speak as they went by
But this was the time of no reply
The time of no reply is calling me to stay
There is no hello and no goodbye
To leave there is no way
The trees on the hill had nothing to say
They would keep their dreams till another day
So they stood and thought and wondered why
For this was the time of no reply
Time goes by from year to year
And no one asks why I am standing here
But I have my answer as I look to the sky
This is the time of no reply
The time of no reply is calling me to stay
There`s no hello and no goodbye
To leave there is no wayIn the bright red sky, in the heat of an evening
When only prisoners sleep
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See an old man weep
She said her dreams were too far to be thought of
Her scars too wide to heal
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See a blind man kneel
She sailed away to a blue horizon
In floating thoughts she'd sway
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See an old man pray
She wished them luck as they left on their journey
Maybe she'd join them soon
But she lost her grip at the tip of life's fingers
Went home and worshiped the moonIf only I could show you how
Everything looks right now
I'd change the words that
I had spoken
And if I hadn't crash my car
You wouldn't have to go so far
To find that I was
Always broken
I'm hoping that your door
Is still open
You say I wake up too late
But I don't
I say that we should sleep in
But you won't
It's never over 'til it starts
Again
You know that I’ve never
Acquired the taste
For having my life
Thrown back in my face
It's never over 'til it starts
Again
So baby let me in
I lost my keys again
I really don't think you know
How everything moved
So slowly on the night
That you first said it
But everything must remain
And everything stays the same
When I remember
To forget it
I hope that I never regret it
You say I wake up too late
But I don't
I say that we should sleep in
But you won't
It's never over 'til it starts
Again
You know that I’ve never
Acquired the taste
For having my life
Thrown back in my face
It's never over 'til it starts
Again
So baby let me in

Because a lot of niggas doin' lot of Fugazi shit out here, man

All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell 
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell 
All you do is lie to me
And dub me, you never love me
Any confidence I came with, you take it from me
I just wanna get beside you and make you love me
I just can not take the silence, you keep ignorin' me
See you makin' all this time for more important things
We was s'posed to catch a vibe the other night
Busy now, but you was down that other time
Why you always lead me on and give me signs
I just wanna get beside and make you mine
I just wanna come inside and reunite
Got me waitin' outside
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell 
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely

Huh, huh
1, 2, 3, hi
Where did you go
When I arrived
What was that look
Saw in your eyes
Nothing is
What it appears
I'm a bit more refined
In my recent years
She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't even
She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find
Do you believe
The things that you hear
Maybe you're wrong
It isn't clear
Another excuse
For me to ignore
It's not quite as simple
As it was before
She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't even
She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find
I'm giving in
It's coming out
You gave it away
I'm thinking about
Not taking it
You're faking it
You're such a sad girl
Sad girl
Where did you leave
Why did you go
What were you thinking
I'd like to know
If walking away
Is all it's about
Then why did it take so long to figure out
She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't even
She said I wasn't even here
She said I wasn't
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
Until you find out
It's only time
It's only time
It's only time
It's only time
It's onlyThe first time I saw you
I thought you were barefoot
Your hair was pulled back
Your jelly shoes, I was wondering if I should lie
About my age
Buddy Holly glasses on a Betty Page negative
You're looking so classic handpicked by some Hollywood executive
Just like Norma Jean
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
Way oh, way oh, way oh, way oh
The next time I saw you
You asked for a reason
I let my love come down
Now you're spending all your time thinking how you're gonna get even
And I'm by myself
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
Good morning now
It's a good morning
The Hollywood ending, it never came easy
The bride to be can plainly see
And now she says she's ready to kill me
And I'm so afraid
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for youVoice from the mountain
And a voice from the sea
Voice in my neighbourhood
And a voice calling me
Tell me my friend my friend
Tell me with love
Where can it end it end
Voice from above
The sound on the ocean wave
And the sound in the tree
Sound in a country lane
Say can you be free
Tell me you crowd you crowd
Tell me again
Tell me out loud out loud
This sound is rain
Tune from the hillside
And tune full of light
A flute in the morning
And a chime in the night
I know the game again
I know the score
I know my name my name
But this tune is more
Voice from the mountain
And voice from the sea
Voice from in my neighbourhood
And a voice calling me
Tell me my friend my friend
Tell me with love
Where can it end it end
Voice from aboveI didn't know you collected souls
Gambling fire, rolling bones
I shoulda known you would take it all
But I never planned to be your voodoo doll
Use your lips to pull me in
Just to stick in another pin
But if you want this heart of mine
Your evil just won't work this time
I'm done with all your bitchcraft
I gotta get my soul back
We've played this game so long
I'm not sure that it will come back
I'm not trying to make you feel bad
But baby I just can't live with all your bitchcraft
Every time you cast another spell
I lose a little more of my free will
Put me in a kettle full of broken hearts
Add a little pinch from your magic jar
Just so I forget the kind of girl you are
Baby I'm catching on real fast
This isn't going to last
And I'm through eating your poison seeds
And I've built up my immunity
I'm done with all your bitchcraft
I gotta get my soul back
We've played this game so long
I'm not sure that it will come back
I'm not trying to make you feel bad
But baby I just can't live with all your bitchcraft
Baby why you gotta act like that
You're not the girl that I thought I had
I guess I thought I knew who you were
And it's a drug knowing you're so quick to kill
It's the only way you get your thrills
But baby I'm about to show you how it feels
Cause I'm done with all your bitchcraft
I gotta get my soul back
We've played this game so long
I'm not sure that it will come back
I'm not trying to make you feel bad
But baby I just can't live with all your bitchcraft
I'm not trying to make you feel bad
I gotta get my soul back
Cause baby I can't live with all your bitchcraftHeart beats, slowly
Leaching of your memories
Crumbles in my chest
Hold peace
At arms length
Sometimes I think is this all worth it
Is music my calling, is this really my purpose
Sometimes I think about quitting and working a desk
Then I think about the time I invest
The time I spend up in the booth
The time I spend giving you the truth
They told me, to get me a career
I told them I would blow up and this would be my year
But thats what I said last year and the year before
The cycle never ends I can't take anymore
Cause I see artists with these fans and these plays
Then I look at myself feel that I'm stuck in a phase
So I just wanna shout out everybody who believes in me
Cause you see something that I can't even see in me
And I don't say that enough
They wanna ride the wave until that shit get rough
But imma stay in it, even if that means I drown
I invested everything I had in my sound
Heart beats, slowly
Leaching of your memories
Crumbles in my chest
Hold peace
At arms length
Next year when I see my fam for Christmas
I don't wanna tell em I'm going to school for business
Told them I did it with music, yeah I did it with rap
Ain't making much pay but I'm making these tracks
I'm spreading this love and I'm getting it back
Man that's what I'm trying to say
I spent so many years just waiting on that day
But it still hasn't came, no it still isn't here
Now I'm stuck looking myself in the mirror
Like am I doing this right
Is this really what I'm gonna do with my life
My mom keeps telling me I need to find jobs
But I'm too busy worried if I'm posted on blogs
I just gotta stay with it
It's true what they say everybody has critics
And I know the road is long and far
But I've been working so damn hard so my heart beats
Heart beats, slowly
Leaching of your memories
Crumbles in my chest
Hold peace
At arms length
And I'll stayBlue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left 
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together moving
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left 
Yo, what i gotta do to get you pussy cat dogs
To not, act hard like I wouldn't jab y'all
You a trap-star, cool i'm a dream catcher
You from New York, stop biting off Atlanta
Pea is a rap terrorist, suicide bomber
I'ma blow up me and everybody around me
You can't show up pea im everywhere you try to be
Here's some advice get nice and don't lie to me
In my last 6 I trumped your whole shiznik
Son I've heard better MC'ing in limp bizkit
Rappers is rugrats, I am DR. Lipschitz
Come to ya shows theres enough space to park with
Wheres your fanbase, with so much damn grace
I plan your demise over eggs and pancakes
First thought of the day the second one goes
I won't stop until I see TM blow
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left 
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left 
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know

Hope there's more to life than this
I'm sure there's more to life than just
Spinning in circles
You got me spinning in circles

The Ruler, it's the Ruler, it's the Grammies when I walk out
I sense the wrong vibe then it's bodies gettin' chalked out
Drakeo be off drugs, he don't really keep a tool
Puttin' bodies on this TEC-9, won't catch me finna drool
It was ding dong ditch when you niggas was in school
Please don't test me, I know you niggas reckless
The johnnies hit the lights, everybody start tellin'
My niggas see the lights, everybody start bailin'
Hoppin' out the driver's seat, had to leave the foriegn
Warrant for my arrest but fuck it, I'm goin' tourin'

Mr. big bank budda, hang with thirty heat sticks
And yes indeed these hands work, bitch we love to see shit
Talkin' 'bout my family, ooh, no Stanley
Twin blowers on my hip, it's your Sam but he Sammy

Room for thirty caskets, guns and clips, we mastered

You think you buy you life, I dare a nigga to snatch it
Frames in the mansion, pussy niggas get Pampers

Bro these niggas so silly, silly billy

Had to execute the clownEverybody said we wouldn’t make it baby
Love don’t live around here much lately
Times are hard and hearts break like the bank
Aw yes they do
Lots of reasons just to give it on up
Leave your soul on the shelf collecting dust
Live in a world of broken promises and empty tanks
Aw but look at us
Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?
Put on a little old Keith Whitley
Back porch dancin’ singin’ with me
I’m no stranger to the rain, no, no we ain’t
Pour a little bit of homemade wine
Make some love, take our sweet time
Why the hell do we complain
Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?
Look at us we got a life out here
Outlaws, in-laws, coolers of beer
Spot on the wall to hang last year’s deer
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Red, white and blue flag hangin’
Kids in the back just a tire swingin’
Fireworks booming and banging
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?
Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?
Oh, oh, yeah
They say we’d never make it baby
Love don’t live around here much lately
What do you think about that?Was Gary Oldman
Ever married
Ever married to
Uma Thurman?
And the actress who was in The Road
Could you tell she wasn’t
Really German?
I don’t know
That’s what she asked me
Last night at the party
Was almost at the door
She’s driving me crazy
But baby, I know she wants me
And that’s for sure
I said
“Give me just a minute
And I’ll take the elevator
To your floor”
I’m fairly certain Audrey Hepburn
Smoked a cigarrete
Out on this terrace
And paparazzi hid behind
That statue they say
She brought back
From Paris
Oh is that so?
That’s what she told me
Last night at the party
Was almost at the door
She’s driving me crazy
But baby, I know she wants me
And that’s for sure
I said
“Give me just a minute
And I’ll take the elevator
To your floor”
Now I don’t mean to brag
You know?
But a while ago
I dated Leonardo
But he left me after
On his yard
He caught me making out
With Jared Leto
Oh is that so?
That’s what she told me
Last night at the party
Was almost at the door
She’s driving me crazy
But baby, I know she wants me
And that’s for sure
I said
“Give me just a minute
And I’ll take the elevator
To your floor”
Baby, I know you want me
Don’t lock the door
I said
“Give me just a minute
And I’ll take the elevator
To your floor”Why leave me hanging on a star
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so high
And why leave me sailing in a sea
When you hear me so clear
When you hear me so clear
When you hear me so clear
And why leave me hanging on a star
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so highAll summer sixteen

You're looking great
Wearing a big smile
On your face
A new pair of shoes
Well, isn't that cute?
I wonder where you're
Running off to
It's not the first time
You've left me behind
Coming home in the middle
Of the night
You climb into bed
What's on your breath?
You say it's just a night out
With your friends
But I'm not stupid
You never hid it well
I could always tell
You never thought I knew
But I was onto you
I should've known
You weren't alone
I heard his voice
On your telephone
Called you at home
Could tell by your tone
Plus I heard his voice
On your telephone
And I'm not stupid
You never hid it well
I could always tell
You never thought I knew
But I was onto you
You made me look like a fool
But really I'm cooler than that
Dude you're doing
You never thought I knew
But I was onto you
I was onto you
But I was onto you
White little lies
And all the pain
And all of these clues
Will finally explain
What you've done
Is out in the open now
And I just wanna say
That I'm not stupid
You never hid it well
I could always tell
You never thought I knew
But I was onto you
You made me look like a fool
But really I'm cooler than that
Dude you're doing
You never thought I knew
But I was onto youBreak me down enough I'll take your side
And all your attitude
I would like for you to just decide
What you're gonna do
Maybe I'll decide I've had enough
Of what you put me through
Then perhaps you could return my stuff
And all my records too
A rusted silhoutette
Embracing burning filament
A verbal avalanche is serving up your innocence
So bye, baby bye
Don't try, baby try
You can do what you want
Stay for a while
I know at the end of the day
I still make you smile
Hum...

Spoke of liberty
All my trials, Lord
Soon be over
There is a tree
In paradise
And the pilgrims call it
The tree of life
All my trials, Lord
Soon be over
But it's too late, my friend
Too late
But never mind
All my trials, Lord
Soon be over
If religion were a thing
That money could buy
Then the rich would live
And the poor would die
All my trials, Lord
Soon be over
All my trials, Lord
Will soon be overWake up
It's time to get your things together
And drive away
Breathe out
You feel today it treats you better
That's what they say
Another day
Gone without a say
But it's okay
If you turn away
And feel the memories bringin' you down
And in the end
Are you stronger?
Do you no longer
Need to recover?
And where have you been
Since it's been over?
Over my shoulder
Under my skin
Will you ever return again?
Wake up
The monsters in your head have left you all to yourself
It's alright
If ugly little things remind you of how it felt
Another day
No one tells you what it means
What's in your way
And poisoning your dreams
The darkest place that you've ever been
And in the end
Are you stronger?
Do you no longer
Need to recover?
And where have you been
Since it's been over?
Over my shoulder
Under my skin
Will you ever return again?
Ooh, ahh
And in the end
Are you stronger?
Do you no longer
Need to recover?
And where have you been
Since it's been over?
Over my shoulder
Under my skin
Will you ever return again?Jimmy is a late-night lover

Her ribbons out of tune
The memories of the past
At the bottom of her glass
And resting on her cheek
The imprint of his ring
A symbol of the weak
Commissioned by the king
Did he tie you down
Did you make a sound
She falls to her knees
Screaming God please
Make something of me
Cause I never wanted anything like what I wanna be right now
An angel again
An angel again somehow
She remembers his old boots
And the shotgun that he shoots
And all she could take
Lies at the bottom of a lake
So lift your cig and drag
As you figure out a plan
To hide it all away
How could she ever love this man
Did you weigh him down
Did he make a sound
She falls to her knees
Screaming God please
Make something of me
Cause I never wanted anything like what I wanna be right now
An angel again
An angel again somehow
And when you carry weight in your life 
And all the plans you make in your life 
The original decision was right
She falls to her knees
Screaming God please
Make something of me
Cause I never wanted anything like what I wanna be right now
An angel again
An angel again somehow
Did he tie you down
Did you make a sound
Did he weigh you down

Dancing neath the sky
'Neath those gallows high
Come on and see me die
Winter is gone

You say I can't write, not yet
You always told me how to be
Now I'm sick of it
Sorry doesn't make it okay
When I'm the one that paid your way
Don't preach
You're drilling a hole in my ceiling
Too bad it won't rain
But who's living without any feeling
So don't you complain
Sorry doesn't make it okay
When I'm the one that paid your way
Sorry doesn't make it okay
When I'm the one that paid your way
Don't preach
I can't believe what you say
How you live, how you love, how you lie
You took my money away
Made me sleep on the floor that I bought
But I don't care anyway
Cause I laugh when you cry
Do you think you would die if I said
Don't preach
Sorry doesn't make it okay
When I'm the one that paid your way
Sorry doesn't make it okay
When I'm the one that paid your way
The house, the bed, the cars and the front door

Let them double Vs shine
Everything with me is greedy with a fuckin' peace sign
Mr. Back at it Again, like my sentence rewind
When I step up in the function  freeze time
In my coup like a cocoon, all my seats is reclined
I'm with Philly counting millies with a gem cuz he odd
Got Shanaynay on the Draco make a nigga beatbox
Pourin' 5s up in the Faygo, know I need to detox

How many times I gotta say if you a fan just be a fan?
How many times I gotta say if you a fan just be a fan?This day is the day that we rise or we fall
This night is the night that we win or lose all
This time is the time that we wait for a while
This year is the year that we wait with a smile
If you call, we will follow
If you show us we can tow the line
And now that you're here you can show me the way
Now that you're here we can try make it pay
For while you were gone it was hard it was cold
While you were gone we were time we were old
If you call we will follow
If you show us we can tow the lineIf only I could have some money
I’d buy myself a home out on the countryside
Where I’d reside
My wife and I
Would have a couple children
They would play out in the yard
We would be the main event
Of everybody’s gossip song
But we’re the loudest house in the block
Cause we’re always throwing pots and pans
And the neighbor’s never liked us
Cause we’re always cancelling plans
Never invited to parties
Cause we never seem to be on time
Rah-ma lah-ma lah-ma
Lah-ma lah-ma lah-ma lah-ma
I’m losing my mind
If only I could have some money
I’d fly as far away from this old cul-de-sac
We won’t come back
Thirty thousand feet below
We’d look down on the world
Mile high
My wife and I
Just me and my favorite girl
But we’re the loudest house in the block
Cause we’re always throwing pots and pans
And the neighbor’s never liked us
Cause we’re always cancelling plans
Never invited to parties
Cause we never seem to be on time
Rah-ma lah-ma lah-ma
Lah-ma lah-ma lah-ma lah-ma
I’m losing my mind
Where we leaving?
We ain't got the money
Where we going?
We ain't got the money
We’re living on food stamps
Bad checks and unpaid credit cards
But we’re the loudest house in the block
Cause we’re always throwing pots and pans
And the neighbor’s never liked us
Cause we’re always cancelling plans
Never invited to parties
Cause we never seem to be on time
Rah-ma lah-ma lah-ma
Lah-ma lah-ma lah-ma lamah
I’m losing my mindAnother drink another roll of dice
Another night I paid the price
And too many times I turned away good advice
Give me just a little more time
I fell in love only once in my life
We'd never fight, well maybe once or twice
Then he came along now this whiskey is my wife
Give me just a little more time
All my regrets carry weight
I'm broke and tired of losing my faith
Lit cigarette with her lipstick stain
Whispering sadly to me
Solo
All my regrets carry weight
I'm broke and tired of losing my faith
Lit cigarette with her lipstick stain
Whispering sadly to me
Curtain call end of the show
It's 4 a.m, and I'm here alone
Bartender please I've got nowhere else to go

My nigga DMac, my young nigga Kid, my lil partner
Scammers from all that, shit is regularThoughts of rain at sunset
Clouds of rainbow blue
Thoughts of sun on sand-dunes
Where the seabirds flew
This was our season, and we said it couldn't end
But my love left with the rain
Thoughts of leaves in autumn
Falling from the trees
Thoughts of horizon tree tops
Leading to the sea
This was our season, no lies and no pretend
But my love left with the rain
Thoughts of springtime rainfall
Touching flowers that bend
Thoughts of wind in willows
Days that never end
This was our season, but sorrow waited round the bend
For my love left with the rain
Rain's the way you move now
Sun the way you seem
Leaves the way you wonder
Flowers the way you dream
This was our season, and we said it couldn't end
But my love left with the rainTelegraph

Hard on my heart and my head

And I ain't talkin' bout Robert when I say I need di nero

Racks on me 
Pull the bitch over, I just whack
Give this bitch a molly, I'm on ecs'If today were not an endless highway
If tonight were not a crooked trail
If tomorrow were not such a long time
Then the lonesome would mean nothing to me at all
And if my own true love were only waiting for me
And if I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she were lying by me
Then I could sleep in my bed once again
I can't see my reflection in the water
Can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo
Can't remember the sound of my own name
And if my own true love were only waiting for me
And if I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she were lying by me
Then I could sleep in my bed once again
There's beauty in the silver, singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
None of these can match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes
And if my own true love were only waiting for me
And if I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she were lying by me
Then I could sleep in my bed once againHow could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
I'm a cannonball
Like my big bro say, I'm goin in
Olimpic loser money, I just glad I learned to swim
CAnnonball, bitch, I hope dive untill it's 30
And I hope when dinners cold, my fingers do not dessert me
And these haters like, damb m
Gave a lot of women they first ride in the phantom
And yeah, I got a deal now, and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so exciting, I get bored with it
I'm the best one out of my peers, and everybody pray I'm running out of ideas
Past my MOs, cause I shine so bright
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures, man, the floor is a collage
Critics have hard time pointing out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky, through the roof of your garage
How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
I'm a cannonballBelieve me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow night
Believe me, pretty mama
Better take your picture too
Don't want to remember
What a good looking girl can do
Don't send me no letter
Don't write me no postcard
Thinking about you, baby
Makes it twice as hard
Believe me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow night
Well I'm sitting here
On the sudden
Watching the trees go by
My baby, at the end of the depot
Lay me down and cry
Believe me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow nightWell I wake up in the morning
Look at my clock
It's way past noon time
Now I'm late for work
Tell me, tell me
What have I done wrong?
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too long
Well I go to find me some breakfast
But I ain't got no food
Take me a shower
But the water don't feel no good
Tell me Tell Me...
I've got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams
Got the devil in my shoes
Tell me Tell me...
Well when I'm smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Don't think about nothin'
Try not to see myself
Tell me Tell me...
Well in this blues I'm singin'
There's a lesson to be learned
Don't go around smokin'
Unless you want to get burned
Tell me, tell me
What have I done wrong?
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too-
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too-
Everything going wrong with me

You’re so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision, and that ultimate responsibility?
Drake:
Yeah, I mean, I think that for the last week and a half I’ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he’s in. I don’t think that there’s a better way to deal with it than how he just did. I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing, I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way, was courageous and was just, to me, I think it’s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation.
I’m just honored to know him and glad that I’ve gotten to, no pun intended, witness this moment for sure. I think it’s an incredible thing.  I actually woke up kind of late today, so I’m just catching on. It’s a great feeling for me. I can’t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he’s been a friend of mine for a long time.
Shell:
Obviously, you’ve joined Saturday Night Live and we’ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we’ve seen in the past?
Drake:
I think obviously one of the talents that I’m able to bring to the ESPYS is music, but I’m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music, but I’m not there to put on a strictly music‑based show. Yeah, we definitely have some incredible pre‑tapes. Yeah, I think it’s just going to be a great night overall. I’m there to deliver a great hosting job.
Shell:
What makes the perfect ESPYS host? We’ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer?
Drake:
Well, I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I’m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don’t know.
To me, it’s just about knowing the room that you’re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve.
Shell:
Hosting a sports awards show, what do you feel is music’s role in sports?
Drake:
Well I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they’re always super into music, whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I’ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league, so I think they’re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other, and I think that’s what really ties music and sports together.
Shell:
This is a question for the producer, and if possible I have a follow‑up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN, was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS? Did anybody reach out? Were you close?
Maura Mandt:
No, there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision, it wasn’t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS, I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year, and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective, and that’s what you look for the host for.
We’re going to be reflecting on the year, and LeBron is something that happened, so it will definitely be something that we’ll address in the show. But just like in sports, we don’t try to make that news happen. It unfolds.
Shell:
Drake, in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance, and a lot of times in hip‑hop that’s kind of also a part of rap music and it’s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage, whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip‑hop?
Drake:
I think that’s a funny question. I think it’s a good fit. I definitely think that hip‑hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we’re not trying to end people’s careers or make people feel bad in any way, and that’s kind of most of the time what problems in hip‑hop are about. So our night, like I said, is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports.
So, yeah, I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words, so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different.
Shell:
You’re also being aware of public perception. For instance, you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer, right, and you so like you definitely have, I don’t know how to put it, maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she’ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you’ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing? Everyone loved it, so can we expect that now that you’ll be hosting the ESPYS?
Drake:
Well, I obviously don’t want to give away the material. But I do have a growing affection for Skylar, and I’m not sure she’ll be able to make it, but I’m sure I’ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I’m sure, if I haven’t done it already, now that I know you’re looking for it, I might stick one in there, for sure. You never know.
Shell:
One of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build‑up.  Today, I don’t know if you realize this, but you’ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means?
Drake:
Well, as far as the latter end of the question, I’d rather not comment on it, but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That’s why I’m excited.
We’ve been working hard, like I said, on the pre‑tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night, which I can 100% guarantee it will.
Shell:
Is Cleveland your new favorite sports city? How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins, Manziel, and LB James into your ESPY segment?
Drake:
First of all, I’d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks, I do not team jump. I’ve been ‑‑ in the past, I’ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it’s the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer, whether it comes to football or obviously basketball, I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams.
So it’s not that I’m team jumping, I’m just a supportive friend. With the recent news, of course I’m going to go ‑‑ of course I’m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron, who like I said has been a brother to me for years, I mean, we’ve got three kids from Toronto on one team, plus we have Manziel who, again, is part of our family and like a brother.
So I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best.
But, yeah, like I said, my teams will always forever be who they are, but, yes, I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland, a place that I’ve been time and time again touring, I just think it’s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they’re just a supportive group of people, and it is a great place, so I’m really excited.
Shell:
So the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you’re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music? You have a lot to write about now that you’re a bachelor again.
Drake:
Well, actually, my status hasn’t changed, just to clear that up. I’ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that, the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something, I don’t let my focus stray.
So for Maura to give me this opportunity to host, I don’t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be ‑‑ to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show, and then from there, I have things coming up, whether it’s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne, which is a real thing, which a lot of people don’t know if it’s a real thing or not, but it’s very real and it’s going to be very competitive. And then from there, I’ll figure out the next steps for me.
I’m always working on new music, but the ESPYS is the main focus right now, and we’ll figure out what’s next afterwards.
Shell:
One thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you’re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne.  With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience, can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show?
Drake:
Yeah, I’m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance, and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character, especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So, yes, I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS, and they’re good. I’m excited.  They’re great.
Shell:
Are you bringing your lint roller?
Drake:
Oh, yes. I think I’ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn’t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in, maybe we would have used the joke. No, I think I’ll be lint‑free that night. I’ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit.
Shell:
So we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits, and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they’re going to wear?
Drake:
I’m not exactly sure what brands I’m going to be wearing. Right now I’m sort of still, like I said, very focused on the show. I’ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I’ll be wearing. But I’m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I’ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that’s really what my main focus is, but I’ll get my suits together.
I’m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won’t have to say anything.
Shell:
You have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven’t met yet that you’re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you’re with already given you any advice about hosting?
Drake:
Well, I mean, I’ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know, one of my mentors who is not an athlete, but obviously Jamie Foxx, a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this, just because that performance that he gave, I believe he hosted twice or three times, oh, twice, right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music, but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I’m looking forward to meeting?
I mean, yeah, I was going to say, I’ve never met Skylar. I’m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up, which she probably won’t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But, yeah, if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It’s been all in good spirits. But, yeah, that is the one person I’d like to meet.
Just for that last person, I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah, Nick whatever his name is, because he didn’t win, so that’s how he’s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is.
Shell:
Can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you, and how many are coming from the writing staff? Also, if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song?
Drake:
Oh, very good double question. Well, for the first part, the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that’s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We’ve been at it now for three months, I think, just on and off, meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine, I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I’m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music, jokes and pre‑taped pieces, I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it.
Is writing a joke harder than writing a song? I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest, raw emotion about my life, I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it’s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it.
But, yeah, I mean, all my music is so honest, that sometimes it’s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you’re able to be lighthearted and joke around, I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do.
Mandt:
I’d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years, one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it’s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we’ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what’s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life, it really elevates it, so it’s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved.
We had a shoot the other day from one of the skits, and on set he was coming up with stuff, and you guys will see it and know what I’m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session, and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I’m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.Digital camera, freeze the moments

I know this shit is crazy, I know this shit is sad
And I can buy me a new whip if I do the whole dash
Crash, smash, now we in the Masi
Poured off a five and nigga please don't tell nobody
I know I'm impatient
I could've got an Audi if a nigga fuckin' waited, mister ungrateful
Thousand blue faces
Mask and a beam, it's an all-black occasion
Take it all, break him off
Duh we really do this shit
Extorting and aborting any next spin Judas's
Listen here you stupid bitch
Mister mister mister fuckin' get dough
Lingo bingo, I just cracked another store
Pops on my knots and a couple grams of gold

For the money and the power I ain't never been a coward
Sour blowin' purple flowers, talkin' reckless to a goddess
I respect none of these thotties, breakin' bitches is a hobby
Molly in the calls, roxy, now she givin' sloppy toppy
Talkin' 'bout you love a nigga, baby put it in my pocket
I just spent a couple Franklins, now a nigga back to robbin'
Flockin' like a couple pigeons, passin' like I'm Aaron Rodgers
I'm a baller lil bitch, I brought them racks out
Ten bands on me, no horn, but I blow loud
Designer on designer fit, it's so wild, sip fours 'til I pass out
Wake up and bring them bags out

Blow them bands, bands

Twenty band statements, hanging out the base fit
Mister ungrateful, mister unfaithful
Broke bitch pay me, broke bitch pay meUh, if you don't like it then slice your wrist

Talkin' about you gettin' it but I ain't seen a dime you spent
You broke, how you gon' rob me, you ain't even got common sense

That's a five and a twenty, best believe I'm out of it
Put that draco down Drakeo, you ain't even think about the kids
Killer season nigga, even babies get shot to death

Eventually forget each others‘ names
And I know the danger in not having control
But some things are too good to let go
I guess
I'm gonna need someone to save my soul
But uh, oh no

In these abandoned rooms
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What is wrong
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What is wrong
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What is wrong with me
Well, I was critical back in middle school
Never thought I’d be the one to make the news
But I left a mess and I slipped away
Never thinking about the future
Or the prices I would pay
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What is wrong
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What is wrong
So tell me, tell me, tell me

So tell me, tell me, tell me
What is wrong
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What is wrong
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What is wrong with meЯ найду каждый кристалл в этом мире
Чтобы стать самым сильным - чтобы дать тебе силу
Чтобы дать тебе все что ты хочешь
Я всю жизнь считал то что ты достойна быть на высоте со мной
И не смотрел по сторонам
Ведь ты и есть мой храм
Но в память шрам
Я держал твою руку
Я искал в тебе счастье
Так почему же я не счастлив?
Этот бесконечный спор между нами он не нужен мне
Я знаю правду
Снова град . начался отчет спустило колесо
Но я сказал что я люблю  а значит бесполезно все
Каждый мой поступок невыносим для них
Не  с высоты смотри
На мои чувства в окружении бездушных толп
Люди будто любят ложь
Они кричат что мои ссадины пройдут но уверен думают что лучше б я сгорел в аду
Я хочу лежать только с тобой в гробу...Laying with my lady on the riverbank
She looked over lazy, and she gave me a wink
She said: "there's no sense a working if it's this dang hot"
So dip your toes in the water, baby this is the spot
Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride
Well, I bought a scratch off ticket
Well, the winning kind
Well, I saw them lucky sevens in that checkout line
I got a twelve pack, big sack
Carton of smokes
Now I'm dancing like I just saw the Holy Ghost
Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride
You got them weekend warriors
Partying all night long
You got them moonshine lovers
Just getting it on
Does it make you feel happy?
Does it make your heart beat?
Does it make you shake it honey?
Does it make you move your feet?
Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride
Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it rideI been trying to do it right
I been living a lonely life
I been sleepin' here instead
I been sleepin' in my bed
I been sleepin' in my bed
So show me family
All the blood that I will bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I don't think you're right for him
Think of what it might have been if we
Took a bus to Chinatown
I'd be standin' on Canal, and Bowery
And she'd be standin' next to me
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
Love we need it now
Let's hope for some
Cause oh, we're bleedin' out
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheartI've been thinkin' 'bout the past
How it seems like nothin' ever lasts
All the moments and the memories in my brain
Spin around to the beginning just the same
You and I were like a song
By the bridge, we knew that it was wrong
By the time we had become a throwaway
We’d spent precious years rewriting shades of grey
But I’m not gonna say it, that it's over
Let’s hold on for a while
Give it time, give me a minute
Maybe tomorrow we’ll find
Everything’s fine
Should’ve known it’d never last
Sinking ships all have a torn up mast
But the comforts of tradition and routine
Were holding us together at the seams
Is there a reason to the rhyme?
Seegar said the seasons have their time
I suppose we’ll never know the purpose of
All the moments that we spend on human love
But I’m not gonna say it, that it's over
Let’s hold on for a while
Give it time, give me a minute
Maybe tomorrow we’ll find
Everything’s fine
Say it, it's over
Let’s hold on for a while
Give it time, give me a minute
Maybe tomorrow we’ll find
I'm not gonna say it ,it's over 
Let’s hold on for a while
Give it time , give me a minute 
Maybe tomorrow we’ll find
I'm not gonna say it ,it's over 
Let’s hold on for a while
Give it time , give me a minute
Maybe tomorrow we’ll find
Everything’s fine
Maybe tomorrow we’ll find
Everything’s fineYou've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me
 
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet meMy only claim before the Father is You

Without Your grace I don’t know where I would be
I can’t believe You see a brother in me
My only claim before the Father is You

It keeps me afloat when I’m drowning in doubt
To me He draws near
He eases my fear with a victory shout

My only claim before the Father is You
No other fount this world could offer would do
Without Your grace I don’t know where I would be
I can’t believe You see a brother in me

Walk into the room, and you can smell the cloud glissening
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrilling bars, you'd think I'm writing with John Grisham pen
I need Rosay, never mind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom, no licence
Fuck if you feelin me, as long as your wife be
No one in my city got a pocket like Drizzy
I got rock fitted jeans, cause my credit card skinny

Fuck you rappers and your self proclaimed statis
I can only see green now, have the same paterns
I know you waiting on the last quote, check the sound scan, you can see that I'm the last hopeI know everyone is enjoying the circus but I want to clarify this image in question. This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This picture is from 2007, a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best Friend at the time Mazin Elsadig who is also an Actor from Sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry, and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed much**Lyrics from Snippet**

Mayfair strange in the summer night
Mayfair strangest in the afternoon
Mayfair stretching far above
Full of fame but lacking love
Could it be we see the Mayfair moon?
Mayfair strange across the park
In the day or in the dark
There's no need to walk or even run
Mayfair faces clean and nice
But beauty here is cold as ice
Could it be we see the Mayfair sun?
Mayfair strange at every hour
Hidden frowns with mystic power
Starry heights and golden throne
Down below you're on you're own
Mayfair strange for passers-by
Sights of wonder for the eye
Could it be they'll pass by again?
Mayfair calling far and near
For even trees are wealthy here
Could it be we hear the Mayfair rain?When we hooked up years ago, you were supposed to come on the show, it didn’t happen but we connected the day after and did a legendary interview in Hyde Park. I said it felt like you’re gonna make history
It’s been a while, that’s kinda how we ended up here. When I got here , I was just like in my room, just tryna find my lineage of coming to London and just trying to figure out where it all started. And I just watched that Hyde Park interview and I’m watching this kid, it’s me but to me it’s just a kid that’s just trying to talk, trying to answer questions in the best way possible. Just the fact that we were just walking around, just me, you, a microphone and a camera. I was like “man I should hit Semtex up, man we should talk again”. I feel like that was a good conversation, we covered a wide spectrum of things and I think it’s been a long time since somebody’s been able to sit down and do that with me, and that’s how we’re here
How’s it feel to go from doing mixtapes, So Far Gone was the mixtape that really broke, before that Lil Wayne mentioned you in an interview with me, and I started following you and it’s just grown. From there you’ve been non-stop, its crazy…
Yeah that was an amazing time for all of us… still doing it with the same people. It was just… our landmark for that project is 15 Fort York, which was “40” and Oliver’s apartment and we really started that project there. Then it moved to the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA, when we were first just getting around Wayne, I know Wayne mentioned me in the interview, but the real turning point for me was when Wayne went on stage at the MTV awards and rapped one of the verses from ‘Money To Blow’. Instead of doing his own verse he just impromptu rapped one of my verses. And at that time, people are like, people from back home who really didn’t….. I mean it was just a tough thing to believe like, “I know he says he’s over there but is he gonna come home with a Lil Wayne record, is this gonna really happen” at that time people were like “ok he just rapped Drakes song, if he gets a Wayne record this is outta here”
That was when I was able to come back off those trips with Ransom. I went back home with Ransom, which was the first time I had ever got a Lil Wayne verse. From there I had a bunch of songs that I had recorded at the studio called Hot Beats and Wayne just got on all of them like ‘Stunt Hard’ and ‘Forever’ was one of them, early early. Then we started crafting that first project and using the input of two people who again I still work with to this day and my music wouldn’t be what it is without them, that’s Oliver and ‘40’ – you know it’s funny cos we’re sitting here talking and they’re back in Toronto executive producing ‘More Life’. Oliver’s executive producing it and ‘40’ is obviously always involved, but kinda just a full circle moment for us, cos Oliver had so much input on ‘So Far Gone’ so I was like “man it would be nice to do something with me and you again”, so I gave him that task and he’s at home piecing it together. So yes it was a great start and from there it just became a wild journey that I guess we’ll talk about
A lot to talk about – ‘More Talk’…
Since we’re right at the beginning, I was in Amsterdam with Lil Wayne….and he tells me – Yo he’s been writing on ‘Detox’ that was like the mythical album, you gotta be about your business to be involved in that, or to be in the studio. How did you end up from doing a tv show to working with Dr Dre, writing for him on Detox? It’s taking it back…
Its taking it back, I’m not usually that good with the ‘taking it back moments’ but I actually remember this one vividly. But yeah, I was on the show and while I was on the show, I started getting less and less character time, because of the fact that everybody was taking a notice to just the fact that I was more focused on music. And at the time I actually had a studio that was right by the film studio for Degrassi, so I ended up working out a deal with the after hours staff where I would leave work, go home get my stuff – Degrassi was all the way in the east end, which is Scarborough that’s like an area of our city. I’d go home all the way back to the city, get my stuff, come back to the studio, I would record and around 4/5am I would sneak back into Degrassi, they’d let me in and I would go to sleep in my dressing room. Eventually they found out what I was doing and they got really upset. During that time I was crafting all these songs, and I had a song that Omen produced – it was me and Mickey Factz and somebody else was on it I think. So Dre had heard the song and he had hit me like, “man I need proof that you wrote this” , so I had to fax him the lyrics of the song, I had to send him a fax message, from my moms fax machine in her bedroom I sent him a fax
You know at that time, Detox was going on, it was more like he had just a camp of people, I guess churning out ideas and just trying to spark something. I was flown out to record at Record One, which is a legendary studio. Yeah I was in there for a while, I did a lot of work, me and ‘40’, always brought ‘40’ with me, that was like a stipulation in my career, I wouldn’t move without ‘40’, so brought ’40’. Got to meet a lot of great people, obviously got to work with Dre, and it kinda all came to an end, when I.. Dre brought me into his office and said “Man you’re doing really good work” and he gave me a $10,000 cheque, and it was the most money I’d ever had in my life and at the time I was in a relationship. So I got the money and I called my girl, and I flew my girl down to L.A and was like “we can get a hotel this is crazy”, it was just a joyous moment for me. And I had missed studio or I had done something wrong, I had let my mind deviate from work and I had missed something, and next thing I know I was sent home and that was kind of it. It was a huge life lesson for me and I still have that… Actually when Dre came out at the Forum, I brought him the $10,000 cheque cos I had saved the actual hard copy of it, even though I got the money for it, they let me keep a copy of the cheque
So yeah that was kinda my dealings with that very early on, and I had heard rumblings, like oh all these people are here and I had met Snoop, and I kinda wrote this song, that ‘40’ still has somewhere for Dre and Snoop. We listened to it not to long, couple years ago, its kinda hard. But yeah it was a great experience, a great learning experience for me and ‘40’, it brought us closer and it just taught us about how this shit really works and I think that set us on our own path
So lets fast forward to 2015/2016, VIEWS one of the most successful albums, the tour you did in America was the most successful tours. How do you feel about what you achieved with VIEWS and the reaction? It’s a very pivotal point for you, going from writing for Dre and being on a TV show all the way up to …
Yeah I mean, it was one of those moments in my career, where the album started to build and build and build and you know when anticipation starts to build, it can either result in massive failure or massive success. Obviously somebody’s watching over us and it resulted in massive success for us and it was also just an opportunity for me to really take a lot of risks that I felt I was ready to take at that moment. And yeah, I mean I was obviously very proud of it from the title to the cover, to just the styles of music that I felt we introduced almost as a package. It kinda started with ‘Work’ because ‘Work’ came out before my album, and then progressed into ‘One Dance’, ‘Controlla’, ‘Too Good’. But just the style of music that was making me happy at the time, because to be completely honest with you I was having trouble figuring myself out in rap at that time I was a very defensive individual just coming off the situations that I’d come off of. I was having trouble trying to make rap music where I was able to peel back the layers and every time I’d make a song – ’40’ is always really bluntly honest with me and was like “Man you really sound like aggressive and defensive” – and I was just trying to figure out why and I realised it was just a reaction to my previous situation that had kinda happened before that
So there was a time where I actually thought about taking the rap off of VIEWS and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody. But obviously I know why I’m here, I know who my core fanbase is, and so towards the end of the album, I tried to execute it as best as I could, on the rap end. You know I still listen to the bars and I know exactly where I was at and they are great to me, and they are time markers to me, but yeah, I guess we’ll get into ‘More Life’ after and how that situation progressed. But yeah VIEWS for us was, it was surreal, the numbers and all the things we were able to achieve, it was an incredible time for us. And of course in true OVO fashion we didn’t celebrate it all, we just kinda went on to working on the next thing. That was kinda it, it was just another album to us, it wasn’t my biggest album by any means, it wasn’t the one to me, it was just another chapter in the story but I’m very grateful for the people who enjoyed it and supported it. Whether people want to admit or not, the influence that it’s had on music, I feel is very evident, whether people don’t wanna say it
Did you know what you were doing when you made ‘One Dance’, Kyla’s on there, Wizkid is on there, it’s a truly global records, because I think very few people have done what you’ve done with mixing everything with the US, the UK and African sounds. Did you know how big it was going to be, it was the song of the year
It really all started with the Kyla record, it was just a song that I had played, we Dj at our own parties just because …
How did you discover it though, that’s like a UK underground Funky Sound…
I mean I just listen to a lot of music and I have friends with great taste in music, so I’ve been personally putting that song in my own playlist and DJ set for like four/five years now, I know it’s older than that, even just playing it and having people… What really set something off for me was having people in America come up to me and be like “Yo what was that song you just played?” and I would be like “man people really like that song but they don’t know it”. So I just, my brain started working of like how could I utilise a bit of it, there’s so many good pieces. So I introduced the concept to ‘85’ and I said to him like “man if we could make a beat, I don’t wanna do a cover I wanna write a whole new song, I just want Kyla to serve as the bridge or as a bridge to the next verse, or as a bridge to the next hook”, and he was like “alright alright cool”
I had the beat for a while, I was just trying to figure it all out, and at that time I had met Wizkid through Skepta, cos we did a remix of one of Wizkid’s songs together and it just kinda all really fell into place naturally. And when it was all said and done, it was one of those moments much like ‘Hotline Bling’, I just didn’t really know how people were gonna feel about it, and that was part of the reason why I dropped ‘Pop Style’ along with it, cos I was kinda almost nervous like man I don’t know, this is just so different, let me just make sure I drop a rap record, so people just know I’m still on my shit. And I remember Boi1da had walked into the studio one night and he had heard ‘One Dance’ and he just looked at me and he’s like “man that’s gonna be the biggest song of your career to date” and I was like “c’mon man it’s like, that’s a lot to say, we hope it does well”. And yeah he was right, and it was just the perfect marriage of a lot of things, so many thank you’s to Kyla for being so supportive, she came out to South Africa and shot a movie with us for this song, and you know of course Wizkid doing his thing, and yeah just the entire UK for supporting it and the world for being open to listening to it
I love that tempo, I love that cadence, those melodies, that’s the music that makes me happy in life, so it was great to just be able to just make something like that and shine light on a song from the UK that deserves it, because that’s truly a classic song
With ‘Pop style’ what happened with that, because when I got it originally it was Jay-Z and Kanye on it and they kinda weren’t on it?
Yeah, I was dealing directly with Ye and that’s the version that he sent me and that was what we talked about and he was like “man you know this is like ‘Pop Style’ featuring the throne, this is huge” and I was excited obviously anybody would be excited to see them link back up. And then I didn’t know what I was gonna hear. So when I heard Jay had two bars, I was like alright it is what it is, it’s cool I like that, it’s a little intro and Kanye goes off. And then you know I’m not really sure the details between how that conversation was miscommunicated or what they were going through at that time, or what anybody felt towards me or whatever it was, I’m not really sure but next thing I knew it just became a bit of an issue. And you know from there I don’t waste too much time, so I just was like alright cool I’ll finish it, I can rap as good as anybody else, so I’ll just go finish this song and put forth my own version cos I don’t really like… you know no one can dangle anything over my head in this business, I don’t play that. So it just needed to be done and I did it myself and yeah both versions exist, so when Kanye comes out to do it at the shows it goes crazy. I know he was really upset cos at that time we were working together pretty heavy and he really wanted to be on the record but you know…
On the Pablo tour, he said a lot of things that are well documented but he said, before the last show, he was talking about how he was sick of not being able to do certain things everyone should come together and just make music. Is it digital politics now that prevents things from happening?
I don’t know, I think everybody has their own little things going on, I’m not really sure what he’s referring to half the time, cos in the same breath, I went from being… like working on a project with him, to him sorta publicly shitting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much. But yeah I’m not really sure, everybody’s got their own thing going on. Again me when I hear that, I just distance myself from it you know, alright if that’s what it is I don’t really even understand the point you’re trying to make but whatever it is that you’re going through, I accept it, I don’t respect it at all. You know cos I feel like me and Khaled are just good people, I’m not sure why we’re the target of your choice that you made that night. And yeah I accept what you’re going through, and I just go and continue working on my own thing. You know the more and more this progresses, the more and more I just feel like keeping to myself, cos its just so unpredictable, you never know which way people are gonna go. I mean streaming is the new record business, so yeah I guess you could call it digital politics, that’s kinda a good name for a song, I might have to do that when I get upstairs
So with ‘Childs Play’ another banger, there’s a line on there where you say why you acting light? What does that mean?
Oh you mean “I’m acting like I’m light skin”, that line , that’s just sorta something people… that’s like very an American thing people say like ‘ah man’ you’re being light-skinned”, I guess they say it’s like ‘emotional’ you know. I just think it’s a ridiculous stereotype, but I was just kinda playing on the irony of it, cos I’m actually light skinned so it made me laugh so I said it. But yeah it’s just a silly stereotype in black American culture, that light-skinned guys are this way or that way, so that was just a little joke
When did you first experience racism, you’re coming from a dual heritage, your fathers black, your mothers white, it puts you in a predicament, when was the first time you really noticed you get it from both sides, or one side or the other?
Man you know, I’ve really been grateful in my life to be born in Canada and just the journey that I had growing up was so… it was just a very accepting journey. I always had friends from all different backgrounds, from different walks of life, we all get along, I never really notice colour, religion, we don’t live like that. There’s really not that much segregation in Canada, and especially in Toronto, it’s like a cultural mosaic. And I know I’ve said that time and time again, but it truly is, it’s made up of so many beautiful people from beautiful places and you get to actually learn and you don’t ever develop hate. You know, the first time I really experienced it, was when I got famous and went to America and people would challenge me, like I don’t understand how it works or like “your Canadian, you’ll never understand, like the Black American struggle, or you’ll never under…..” That was the first time I really got challenged, and it was by people I had met from America that were like even close to me at the time
You know, if I ever feel anything or if I ever feel like an outsider, it’s usually because I’m not American to be honest with you, that’s when I feel like people are against me or they feel like I’m not part of the…. I guess it’s got something to do with the fact that I have quite an eclectic make up, I am mixed, I am Jewish. Yeah but I feel like, at the end of the day when it comes to everything else I’m Black. I am referred to as a Black artist, last night at that Awards show, I’m a Black artist. I’m apparently a ‘rapper’ even though ‘Hotline Bling’ is not a rap song. The only category that they can manage to fit me in is a ‘rap’ category, maybe because I’ve rapped in the past, or because I’m Black, I can’t figure out why. Just like I can’t figure out why ‘One Dance’ wasn’t nominated, maybe because they can’t… I mean, well it’s just there’s pop obligations that they have and I fluked out, I fluked out and got one of the biggest songs of the year that is a pop song and I’m proud of that, you know. I love the rap world, I love the rap community, but you’re right I write pop songs for a reason, I wanna be like Michael Jackson, I wanna be like artists that I looked up to, those are pop songs but I never get any credit to that
And shout out… and by the way I’m speaking to you as a winner from last night, I won two awards last night, but I don’t even want them, cos it feels weird for some reason, it doesn’t feel right to me. I feel almost like alienated or you’re tryna purposely alienate me by making me win rap awards, or either just pacify me by handing me something, putting me in that category, cos it’s the only place you can figure out where to put me. And remember they don’t decide the winners, but they do decide the nominations so they have to play it politically. And shout out to Chance, for last night, like I said I’m speaking from a winners point of view and I’m so happy for him, I’m not talking about.. I’m not angry about how last night worked out. But when you ask me like where, like do I feel, like racism, or do I feel it the same as everyone else, yeah I feel it, I notice it going on in it’s own places. But thankfully I get to be around the greatest group of people, my friends are from all over the place, they like Lebenese, they’re.. I’m Jewish, most of my friends are from the Islands of Jamaica, English, so I mean, we just don’t really notice it like that until I start talking about the music business
Yeah it’s a really tough time in the world and again that statement has been said over and over again and I think we know it’s a tough time and I’m …
How did it feel to be on stage in Manchester when the Grammy’s were going on, you stuck to the tour..
Yeah I mean I did it because that at the end of the day is what matters to me that’s real life you know. I was pitched by the Grammy’s to cancel those two shows and fly and go sit in the audience to lose because they don’t air the other rap awards on TV. So I would have left 30,000 people hanging to sit there and just be there for their own ratings you know. The worst part is I expressed myself, like man I’m really thankful I was at those shows in Manchester cos those were two of the strongest shows that we’ve had so far. I texted somebody from the Grammys and was like I’m really glad I stayed behind, I really don’t wanna have this conversation about coming out there again and I got a text back that said ‘Blame It On Donald Trump’ – and I’m not gonna say who it is that I’m texting but this is like the institution, we’ve been conditioned to think that this it the true award for our accomplishments, for our music. By the way if you had a night like Chance last night, he deserves it, for his friends, for his family, for his collaborators, its amazing when they champion you. But all I’m saying is, to kids that will be coming up in the future and might now get championed or might not get that moment, that’s OK too. Because you have to realise what institution you’re dealing with. You’re dealing with a bunch of people that are just people at the end of the day and they’re either good people to the core or bad people to the core and we’ll never know. But I mean yeah, I was really glad that I was in Manchester last night, and like I said I’m speaking from the perspective of a winner, I won two awards, it’s just it really put it all in perspective for that thank God that I stayed here and did what I’m supposed to be doing for the people that actually care about my music, you know. Yeah man, that’s just kinda how I feel about that about this given timeJoey will come to see your flowers
Joey will come to while away your hours
But she will tell you you're not so good for her
She wouldn't be there if it could be that you were
Joey has loved but never shown her tears
So she may laugh in the autumn of your years
And when you're with her, you'll wonder if it's true
All they said of a world without you
Where she may come from
Where she may go
Who she may run from
No one will know
Why she was late may trouble you some
Still you wait for Joey to come
Joey will come when once more it looks like snow
Joey will come when it's really time to go
And you may smile when you find that you've been wrong
You thought you'd found her but she knew you all alongDeep down in the depths of forgotten dreams
So far away so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand
As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand sighs
I called her my princess of the sand
She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess in the sand
One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone. of her presence there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand
Sometime when the summer nights come back
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, and i'll hope to find
That strange young dream, close behind
I'll call her my princess of the sandSheesh
I guess this make number two, huh
Damn
Duse makin' slaps, true
Ugh, shit I guess that's me, huh
Got Metro Boomin in the back tryna rip all my seats out
Ugh, now tell me what that beef 'bout
Find your brains in the street, your body by that seaside
Zoom zoom zoom, I had to bleed down the block
Chinky chinky, you smell the stink on my knots
Feds knockin' at my door, they must've found another box
Shananay keep singin', they must've found another Glock
