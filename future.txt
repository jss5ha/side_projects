Changes
Is you gon' do somethin'?
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like
We like fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria
But I don't see it, I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic
Tapped in when I'm maxed in Comp-Town with the MAC-10s
And the pumps in the background I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
Everything else, but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Bùyào, bùyào"
Tee off the day, know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feelings, fuck your culture
Fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast carsYo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude
Shouts out to L-Boy, awwwwk
I told you
The big-eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, "Catch up, nigga," it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark-skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead 
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five-panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me 
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice
What's up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak 
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher 
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, "Get 'em, Mike G," then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area 
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? 
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right
Rent a supercar for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pothead, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell 
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch 
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit 
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap 
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat 
Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips
 Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face 
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word
And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah
Golf WangHigh, high, get, get, gettin' high, everybody gettin' high
Get, get, get, gettin' high, you're unbelievably high

It's like eviction number four now
Go 'head and ash it on the floor now
Girl go 'head and show me how you go down
And I feel my whole body peakin'
And I'm fuckin' anybody with they legs wide
Gettin' faded with some bitches from the West Side
East coast, nigga reppin' North Side
Never waste a ho's time 
Bitch, I'm on my own time
Fuck a nigga co-sign
Always change my number and my phone line
Baby girl, I don't lie
Used to have no money for a crib
Now my room service bill cost your whole life

Taking pain pills on the plane, gettin' chartered
Poppin' tags on tags, I was starvin'
Bitch, I got the juice and the carbine
Turn a five star hotel to a traphouse
Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, gettin' money my religion
Got my baby momma and my side bitch kissin'
I turn the Ritz into a lean house
This the sixth time gettin' kicked out
I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous
Niggas tryna ride my fuckin' wave, now they salty

Shoot you in your back like you Ricky
Lil Mexico, with no life to afterlife

My uncle Don, that nigga used to rob banks and shit, rest in peace
My granddaddy was a boss, he was a kingpin, you heard?
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'
Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
'Sco came to me, said, "They think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one"
We going back in soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him into custody, they took my life away
People didn't even understand that
My hard drives that I recorded all my music on
For two years straight was on this...
Was on this one hard drive that Esco had
And he was locked up with it
So I had to record new music
That's when I did Beast Mode
I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggys
I endured so much pain, ain't got 'Sco with me
Ain't got nobody to smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean, man, when I was OT
And I'm still dealin' with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag, we gettin' back to the paper
Gettin' back to the basics
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hatin'
I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick layin' on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doin' some real life porno
And I ain't worried 'bout nothin' in the world, keep a badass bitch
These niggas ain't none of my worries, damn that shit
There's so much more I gotta endure
I just had my baby, gotta go on tour 
Got the game from them old niggas

And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'
I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio, give 'em what they was missing
They didn't know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They ain't know me in the cut, they just know me from rhymin'
My hard work finally catchin' up with perfect timin'
You know what I'm saying
I could take a hundred dollar slab
And goddamn make three hundred off that bitch, you dig?
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga

One look out my window, there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and it was silent
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I'll forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love like you forget a daydream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
We'll all fade to grey soon, on the TV stationYou know

In a four-door Bimmer, driving with a rifle
Nigga, where you at?  nigga, we gon' pull up on ya
Young bitch looking like Janet in the '80s 
We was grinding up from two and a baby

This life is a game if you wanna play, counting all your old mistakes
Living it with no delay, so fast I'm getting growing pains
Father didn't show me my instincts to take the open lane
I go insane, all these problems comin' with my growing age
Blowing haze, tryna clear the doubt that's sitting on my brain
I don't complain but the kid inside me's feeling so restrained
Gotta stay gold and let desire rekindle the flame
Searching for the Fountain of Youth when I'm freein' my brain
Bring in the horns, you hear that fucking brass?
That's little boy nigga with the trumpets
Marching with the bandwagon, looking for his heart
No sleeve, but his hand carry muskets
Lurking in the meadows, oblivion
Motherfuck Geppetto, he's a leader, not a puppet
Some professors nuttier than Klump's dick
So think before you blink and aye-aye make assumptions
Your left, your left, your left, right left
Your left, your left, your left, right left
They want a story, a story I write the shit that I find
Very amusing, 'cause all of they fucking stories are boring
It's really awkward to know that a bunch of kids do adore me
It's like I fathered these fuckers, so you won't find me on Maury
I'm still a kid in my heart so I have a problem maturing
But it will come from experiences and shit I see touring
I'm like a bird when I'm soaring, really high
And I'm really horny, from watching this porn, nope, but
Bring in the horns, you hear that fucking brass?
That's little boy nigga with the trumpets
Marching with the bandwagon, looking for his heart
No sleeve, but his hand carry muskets
Lurking in the meadows, oblivion
Motherfuck Geppetto, he's a leader, not a puppet
Some professors nuttier than Klump's dick
So think before you blink and aye-aye make assumptions
Your left, your left, your left, right left
Your left, your left, your left, right left
5, 4, 3, 2, and where's Tyler?
Bottom of the countdown, shit ain't been the same
Since I found out Hodgy Beats ghost wrote for Bow Wow
Now I’m the loud, shock value style, foul-mouth fucker
That your teenage kid likes to bow down
Riding around town in Seattle
With the same shotgun that Kurt used to click-clack, boom-pow
Still suicidal but some assume that I'm cool now
'Cause I got a fucking award and my own room now
Nope, but I can flip shit like a couch pillow
And have my death silent like a loose vowel
The bandwagon turned into caboose, so
So, don't let that little nigga trumpet lose sound
Just let him playYeah
This bitch from Australian and I'm an alien
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy, but I love it, baby
When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter and the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose
Never gon' lose 'cause these bitches gon' choose
These bitches gon' be who they is
Walkin' and talkin' like classy
You a ho to your heart, you a ho to your heart
You know I'll be workin' that boy, I'ma pour it
Servin' that boy out the back of the yard
Fuck on your ho, I'm just playin' my cards
Whip after whip put up in the garage
Sip on the lean like a fifth of the dark
Hop in the Spur, then might hop in the Porsche
Telly then rally and gather the squad
Yeah, girl eat the squad
Me and my niggas so mothafuckin' tight
You can't even tell us apart
Fuck a bitch every single damn night
Ain't nothin' but an avatar
Valet the car on the curb like I'm swervin' on alcohol
Get to poppin' them Percocets and Xanax like they some Tylenol
I remember nights in Europe sayin' we ain't fallin' off
I'm on a lot of green, we gotta have some green
When I hit the plane and I board it
I got a magazine with no Visine
Just ridin' around with this .40
She gon' thug for me, she gon' thug for me
In Ohio, that's my shorty
We ain't playin' around these 
We gon' go upside your noggin
You see they try sabotage me, then copy
They wasn't playin' fair no-no, no-no, no-no
Bitch is a bozo, she clown in the photos
We sell that coco, you talkin' to po-po
You know that's a no, though, you know that's a no-no
Know that's a no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no
Came at the door, pour, serve out the paddy door
Bitch I'm your man and your daddy, ho
Panty droppers had no panties on
Bitch, you steppin' in, no panties on
Back with these stallions
Back-to-back, back, back-to-back with these stallions
Like she trunk after trunk, I just carry on
Got the sack on me, now I just carry it
Got some M's in New Orleans, I buried it
For the cash and some M's, I'll marry it
See the way they just jumped on the bandwagon
Went bought a G-Wagen
Fifty-six nights, I had to get at it
Mayweather, Pacquiao, nigga, we still at it
Get up and get at it, guns like I'm Bin Laden
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy, but I love it, baby
When I jump out the whip, when I hop out the whip then I'm fresh in the latest
I do what I want, and I smoke 'til I'm faded
I drink 'til I pass out, I wake up and drink up again
I pour up again and again
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch, then I fucked her again
I scream out the gutter and the sewer, the streets turned a boy to a man
I nodded off with that Ruger, I took your bitch to Aruba
She fuck with Super 'cause she got that super
When I say super, that's young Super Future
We never gon' lose, we never gon' lose
Woo
These bitches gon' choose
We never gon' loseWhy did we go all the way?
What do we do, ohhh, when it rains?
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true
Hold on, hold on, hold up Future, what the fuck you doin'?
You can annihilate way more chicks than the chick you screwin'
You on top of your game, homie, man you a star
You got real bitches, they love that nigga that you are
They say you're like Jimi Hendrix, in his early twenties
You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career
You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real
And I can't even lie, dog, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And Imma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live
Aye just do me this favor, you give it time, time reveals
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true
We've been in the same place, for a long, long time
If our hearts go the wrong way, I still know you're mine
Should we even try to fight it?
If our love is trapped in all ways
I know that things been rough
But when you're by my side
It's more than enough, yeah
For us to make it through the test of time
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true
Standin' in the middle of humility
Can't nobody never love you more than me
Can't nobody never love you more than me
If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need
I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true
Real and true
Real and true
Real and true
Real and true
And I can fight temptations off
I ain't soft, no I ain't soft
You can't be lettin' the rap shit go to your head
Can't be cancellin' no shows, fuckin' up your bread
Check out these rumors, that ain't nothin' but the devil
That's why we gotta continue to pray together
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and trueI've been in the stu late, workin', no residuals
If we never speak again, I'm just glad I got to tell the truth
I ain't done countin'
You wanna come to paradise?
Matter of fact, you wanna come to Pluto?

I'm tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial
And these codeine habits ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
No this codeine ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child

Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
Can't be the one and then you get exposed

It's somethin' 'bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, since Evisu
Made her switch sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chickens, then mail them
Take 'em to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, you never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby

She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian? Super sensation
Yah, sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches betrayed me
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city

Throw the sauce on it, got it flying out of Dallas
Hope you didn't do it to yourself, that's tragic
Hope you didn't throw away what we established
Hope you wouldn't turn your back on your family
The way a nigga look 'round here, they'll back stab you

Coming through the cut like a known Grim Reaper

True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
Had the Parkay jumping out the Pyrex
High definition glass on my pinky finger
Niggas swimming in the water, no paddle
Niggas trying to walk in my shadow
The bird on the bezel, I'm a well known rebel
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella

Help me fight my demons off, know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a cougar, she didn't wanna leave
Treat her like garbage, my heart was on my sleeve
Should've chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if you can get it out the creep?
Why should I have trust for you? You ain't get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you? You ain't kneelin' to my feet
Why should I be carin' when I know I can't be beat?
See how the ice be glarin' when I come through and retrieve
It's easy to know it's us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili

I was self motivated, I was self driven
I got my determination, now I'm really winnin'
We could pull up Maseratis, I done whipped the Benzes
I was handin' thousands out when I go shop at Lenox
When it come to stackin' cash up, it ain't no limit
I got racks on top of racks and I ain't talking tennis
It's some girls that's gone wild, I like to see them kissin'
It's some niggas playing foul and they sneak dissin'

Saw me microwaving dope, like some leftovers
Drugged in with the green grow, a lawn mower
I’m a Michael Fox, George Jetson, Elroyer
I'm a space cadet, an astronaut, a rockstar
I was trapped in the trap, dodging cop cars
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Jupiter, and Mars
You ain't foreign, it's okay, I like all broads
I'ma hustle everyday so I don't never starve
Hit the block and sell drugs

Pour a half a pint of codeine in a two liter
Scorchin' hot flame, all that Future drop is heaters
I put passion in my lyrics and I'm working, nigga
Got a dogfood connect; DMX, nigga
Got a styrofoam cup, and I'm doubled up
Think I'm Usain Bolt, ran my bands up
Ain't no pressure on my money, ‘cause I'm certified
All these diamonds 'round my neck, it got em mesmerized
All these drugs inside my system got me super high
Posted up and servin' junkies, been a long time

After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it

Bought the Bentley coupe and a Bentley Spur on the same day
She drove the GT and fell in love with it the same day
She told me that was her favorite car, she dreamed about it

These four doors and quaaludes, they got me dehydrated
Turn on me, sue me, no, nothing seems to amaze me

Remember we jugged for somethin'
Remember we take for somethin', yeah, yeah
I spent three stacks on these Rick Owens, I try my best to forget it

Simplism, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club

Okay, welcome to my 12 bar 
The beat, wears it like a kevlar
As I smoke my tree, medlar, South African
Coughing 'til there's pains in my fucking abdomen
I spit negative just like a halogen
My breeze more of a fucking masculine
The rascals win, killing 'em off with a javelin
Snakes, I'm just rattling, suit tailor never tattling
You niggas a bunch of squares, Madison
As far as real niggas, bitch nigga my battle's sick
On top of being talented, bitch I'm fucking passionate
I'm a golden curse, call me treacherous, treasure chest
Better yet, I'll build on to the beat like tetris
Remember me forgetfulness? I am your correctionist
I stitched Odd and Future together like a leather vest
You fucking sweater neck, feather peck, Rosetta checks
I put together decks and push for beef, if hefferless
I'm headed out to Sydney Australia with Tim Donnelly
He gets caught up at security, the TSA don't follow me
Tea parties are the shit, forty mags by the scones
I'm fighting for gun rights to shoot a nigga in his dome
Click your fucking heels, there's no place like home
Cock back and blast off written on the tombstone, ain't that a bitch
That wasn't a 12 bar 
I can't count 
Let's see, what's wrong with me?
Might be my fucking Tourette's, see?
I need a vacation cause all this shit got me stressing
So after the showers with Sandusky
Me and Sean Kingston went and rented a couple jet skis
Lionel rolled the blunts up, so meanwhile
Me and Lucas getting fucked up
You can smell us coming like a faggot when he hicks up
Listening to Common's last album to get pumped up
To finally ask *censored* when I can get my dick sucked
You know Casey Anthony, was handling
Dropping her kids off so she could come out and dance with me
Wine in the pantry, wrestling on my trampoline
Learned some new chords while you uncreatives were sampling
I'm Wolf, I spit flow retardedly
As retarded as the sound of deaf people arguing
You hold the future of the kid you daughter's gargling
Me, I have the Odd Future mothafuckin' sergeanting
 No, I'm the fuck now
My poppa didn't give one, that's why I'm like this now
I'm still down to cut throat and if another fan asks
For a fucking photo while I'm snacking on my pizza lunchable
I'm 'a fucking snap like Berman when he acts right
Then have a mental breakdown and proceed to use a crack pipe 
OF will be done for, niggas will be dumb poor
Don't believe me, ok be right back, I'm headed to the gun store
M-16's and them 6 teens came out of nowhere
Like your kid's wet dream, what you mean old news
Oh you really need us to fucking show you
That we're harder than findin a fuckin Snicker bar in Whole Foods
In a black hoodie, nose bruised and a gold tooth
Hoping the fuckin' security guard doesn't hold you in custody
But luckily had a couple of guns with me
Like gay step mom, none of you mothafuckas can fuck with me
Vete a la casa de tu mama

Bringin' pressure, I get pleasure
Chrome Berettas, no vendetta
I know my heart belongs to the ghetto
Responsibilities without humility
Longevity, car from Italy
Fuck my enemies, get my salary
Fuck envy, end in tragedy
I'm your majesty, that's how I gotta be
Get more liberty, should be proud of me
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?

What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh
Comin' from poverty, hittin' the lottery
Hottest commodity, the way that it had to be
Ain't no comparin' me, you thinkin' charity
I'm thinkin' integrity, and worryin' 'bout the legacy
That I went through, thinkin' vicariously
I'm in a spacecoupe, that's momentarily
I've been dead broke, treated unfairly
Never break me, love or hate me
She did forsake me, she wanna taste me
And she showed it, gave her the blue face
Gave her blue paper
What I'm supposed to do when these racks blue?
Ooh, ooh

Nigga, we ain't runnin' from no responsibilities
I take care of families
I'm embarrassed over this mess that I done caused
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile
Gotta keep it stashed up for the trial
Material intentions, gotta play it foul
I'm in rare form like a hyena runnin' wild
All the opps gettin' gunned down
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile
I lost connections to the streets and I was in denial
I seen a grown man shed tears 'cause he lost his trial
I saved the streets, a crazy feeling just to lose a child
Have a one-on-one with God, yeah, it been a while
I woke up paranoid off drugs, I said, "I'm tired now"
I answer my phone in the middle of the night, like, "Who done died now?"
Knowin' I'm involved, but we gon' slide back when it's dyin' down
I don't know who opps no more, you look crazy, I'm firin' rounds
I love the streets, it's a portion of me
I came from nothin' to the voice of the streets
I got blood in the streets
The way he died, I advise he died in his sleep
That's the trenches, yeah, yeah
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile
Public conversation got you touchin' clouds
Popped the wrong pill, hit the wrong dial
Ain't no visitation, waitin' for the trial 
Took my last name, this ain't 'bout the child 
Real classy Jazzy, real don't do no trollin'
Gotta treat you like you dead when you playin' bogus
See, Pluto, you my brother, gotta stay focused
Sometimes I get in my feelings, too, I wish I wore a Trojan
They tryna go viral off DMs, that's why I'm antisocial
I'm just tryna teach the killers not to use emotion
I got a whole bitch, don't think about my old bitch
I'm just tryna live my life and catch this moment, yeah
I can't go to sleep, I'm paranoid and it's way too many homicides
Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Fuck the bitch once, now she wan' cry
Snitches told the feds, I had an alibi
Brokenhearted, fuck my bitch every night
I don't know her name, she wanna have my child
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild
Numb to the pain, so I keep a smile
We can't even get no sleep behind this shit
You make a temporary decision
That cause permanent pain
Shit ain't goin' nowhere 
That hood mentality feel like you can go through anything, nigga (Bought a hundred guns, got my niggas slidin'
Laughin' to the bank, got me runnin' wild

That's just the dark side of me
Some nights, it's hard for me to fall asleep

When the lights go out, I need to know
Are you afraid of the dark?
I'm not afraid of the dark
I am not afraid, I am not afraid 
Sick of the oppression and all the hate 
Money and the power, social rank 
Lot of pride now, not enough loyalty 
Had to change my life for the better things 
Had to boss up and overcome adversity 
I put my brother in position 
I know some didn't see the vision 
I'm just livin' by tradition
And I'd die for my respect 
And I'd die for my Patek 
You might die for disrespect
And I'm not afraid

Started off in the trenches, how I'ma ever go pop?
Already on the moon, already with the goons
Already on shrooms 
I'm already on Easter, I'm already as a teacher
Watch for the throne, I'm like Yeezus
They tryna clone me, thinkin' I don't see 'em
They take subliminal shots thinkin' we don't hear 'em
I'm one-of-a-kind, that's how I'm gon' kill 'em
I've got a human heart
I've got a human heart
Are you afraid of the dark?

A feeling, not an item, appearing up out of thin air
Conquer everything that's in front of me
Now they under me
Rush to lead and respond, they strayed away how a tunnel be
Took a leap of faith
Bungee cord about to give out
Now-a-days, whatever you say you gotta live out
Altitude, havin' parachute failure, we got a problem!
Grow a set of wings or die when you hit the bottom
Never prayed to God, but never too late to try him
Shots fired, Allen Iverson in the league
They say I ball hog and I'm not a part of the team
Breadwinner with these winners, built the regime
Taliban weapon in hand, kill everything
Amphetamines all for the state of a better means

Don't act like you don't know
Know what I came for
Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one

Living on fire for residuals
365 when I grind for residuals
45 magnum in the van with 'em

I say, "fuck the whole world" and put a bomb in it
Finger on the trigger 'til I put my whole arm in it
I just want revenge
I just want revenge
We get it poppin' everyday
They took away my happiness, they tryna take my head away
You walk at night, you walk at Glam
I'm bound to 'cause some problems with it

Too late to turn back
This is the payback
You take one, I take one

Fishscale projects made a man out me
Sleepin' on the carpet made a man out me
Full of medication, I wouldn't change it

Ran round the wailing world
And what’s a song without you?
When every song I write is about you
When I can’t hold myself without you
And I can’t change the day I found you
On these roads
Out of love, so it goes
How it feels when we fall, when we fold
How we lose control, on these roads
How it sings as it goes
Flight of field, driving snow
Knows the cold
Out of love, so it goes
How it feels when we fall, when we fold
How we lose control, on these roads
How it sings as it goes

Here with three white divas who snort and like penis
I'm hotter than at least five heaters
In the middle of the summer with a sleeved wife beater
Pure bred degenerate, gentleman
Little Aryan nigga with hairy clit for dinner
It's Wolf Gang, triple six, niggas on that simple shit

As weather where them bitches wear bikinis with polka-dots
It's overly overkill, because my niggas know a lot
About tapin' them, rapin' them, throw them overboard from a yacht
So now they probably hate me but that's why the fuck I'm here
And you really should man up, there's no need to be sincere, faggot

That'll leave you on the ground like your rap career?
So you don't want it don't start none
We're fuckin' Radical, been Fuckin' Awesome

First, I had bought a Bimmer, then I had bought a Benz
I pray for me and my niggas, 'cause we live a life of sin
Some'll get joined in, most of us born in
Open the door for me, I'm already goin' in

Give me love, that's what I need, that's what I need
I'll travel through time, I walked the line and overseas
Before we do anything, we're doing us
I didn't have no more patience, I was in a rush
I fell in love with music, just like us
You work at Magic, baby can you love me?
You see the moon comin' out at night
I got a wolf standin' by my side
We do these girls three at a time
I'm in my world, I'm out of time
Three different highs, I'm off the ground
Look in my eyes, you see my trials
You see my tribulations, I was down
I seen the sweat running down the wall
We tryna have a good time
We toastin' it up at the juke joint
Sit by the bar at the juke joint
Made love in the car at the juke joint
I'm standin' in the middle of an orgy
I put a smile on a whore bitch
I feel like my life is completed
I feel like it's timin' with everything
I feel like it's timin' with everything
Feel like it's timin' with everything
I stood in the middle of an orgy
She did it right, it was gorgeous
She lookin' right, she was gorgeous
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
Sometimes I'm rappin' this
When I know I shouldn't be doin' this
Hopin' that the end results
I don't aim to ruin this
Palm trees influenced this
Chronic trees influenced this
Tootsies in Miami
These girls, they influence this
The JW Marriott in Dubai, it influenced this
Take a few laps on the horses before the sun sets
And I can see it from my window
I can see this from my window
I feel like it's timin' with everything
Feel like it's timin' with everything
I stood in the middle of an orgy

I wanna live like a drug lord, but I wanna be glorious
Sometimes I feel like a kingpin, I'm so victorious
I got a white and a black girl, they look like an Oreo
I come through poppin' it off, call the coroner
You see these chains on my neck, look like Mardi Gras
I'm throwin' the cash in the air like a volleyball
Pink shirt on me just to match my diamonds
NASCAR Lamborghini when I'm drivin'
Big dawg but I feel just like a giant
Withdrawals, pass my cup, I think I'm dyin'
Say fuck the drug test, go'n pass my gas mask
Flat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked
Super like Goldie Mack, ho caught an asthma attack
Hoes gettin' their toes tagged, kill 'em dead at Hermes
Turn up on purpose, I have her nervous
I don't have no stylist, make my own purchase
Low top my Gucci, I was wrapped in turban
Knew she was a hoochie, I had to murk it
Now I got power, I feel like Curtis
I gave her Pucci, I felt like she was worth it
I wanna live like a drug lord, but I wanna be glorious
Sometimes I feel like a kingpin, I'm so victorious
I got a white and a black girl, they look like an Oreo
I come through poppin' it off, call the coroner
You see these chains on my neck, look like Mardi Gras

Say farewell to the brain cells, neutrons can smell us
My niggas keep enough green to get a bush jealous
Roll tighty, the joint righty, go buy a label
And busters don't get the zimper in Chris Lighty, alrighty
Or maybe a swisher, I begin to kiss her
Keepin' all the arms and limbs in a large bin
My niggas keep mary jane like a fucking Tarzan
In the fuckin toilet where my bars been
They been the shit since Riley figured out she really likes Dark men
Domo hitting bowls, nuggets size of coals
Rolling a whole 'nother blunt the size of a troll

Sees us strolling to 7-11 to get a Arizona
And some donuts, he'll be in a hole, but we're not gonna let it happen
Im not talking music when I say were the best at wrapping
The kush, coke, Ritalin, and mushroom caps in my system, um
I break number 2 pencils cause I write so strong
Tyler rolling up a stick so when it lights, so long
Brass monkey, clarinet, ten drop in the gong
Gas mask, vaporizer, tranquilize you with the bong
Imagine gas and 'laxing, puff passing past tense
Future kush, cool tour, poke your arms blue or
Dream, smoke white like vanilla bean ice cream
Besides OF, Mary Jane and me make a nice team
Pause, aw you getting too fat, bitch
Munchies, gaining weight is fucking automatic
Can't fit into the plus size of that sack's fifth

So rush down, bitches want a star beat like old Bapes
Where Davon at? cause he can Zieir too
Big Cam Lawrence kid, you can even call Lionel
Tyler dog, hit it once for the game
Give it to Hodgy Beats then dish it off to the Brain
My eyes heavy, someone give me a orange juice
Louie V shades so my thoughts don't support you
Thoughts decreases, hunger builds in my torso
Paper plane on paper plane, can I please aboard you
You, you, uh, ayo Vyron, light that one
Kush, coke, X, mushroom

I'm Atheist, so I let the blunt bless her
Higher then a fat nigga bitch blood pressure
On the dresser is the kush compressor
That four cents of bags of fluorescent flower pedals
Take a hit of this shit, inviting some
Bitches over to the crib, take a sniff, feeling numb
Baby girl, this is love, mixed with coke
And the eighty proof is in the pudding, so is a pint of cum
This is fun, don't you even try to run
Get you high, get you drunk, oh wait, you're not even real
This is fucking fake, snow white is in my nasal
I don't even think I'm able to shimmy passed the table
Without tripping on cables, me and Travis crying
Earl is probably dying, Cedric licking walls
And all of us tripping balls, heart beating in a trance
I'm in a submissive stance, I'm not fucking playing
When I say call the ambulance, shit
Call the fucking ambulance

I float like balloonsThe sea was large today
Just as any other day
But something broke in me
Watching on this winter’s eve
Like a voice, that I’d been trying to hide
Pulled me close
And out into the undertow
I can’t beat it
Oh! The sirens sing me home
Just can’t release it
I didn’t have the strength to go
She’s a garden rose and blossoms head to toe
And even when she leaves her golden shadow stings
I can’t beat it
Every time she goes, cuts me even deeper
If only I’d the strength to go
Like she does
But she’s got time on her side
And she’s free to decide
Because she’s got time on her side
To be young is divine
And scaling the dunes to sea
Where the white wall feeds
Gets me no closer to peace
From the grips that she holds on me
Oh! I can’t beat it
Every time she goes
Cuts a lil deeper
So the wound will never close
If only I could beat it
She wouldn’t look away for woe
But it finds me when I’m sleeping
And wakes me in a fevered low
Like she does
But she’s got time on her side
And she’s free to decide
Because she’s got time on her side
She’s so free, it’s sublime
I just wonder if I’m on her mind
As she’s on mine, all the time
And I want her to know that I’m on her side
I’m on her side
The sea was large today
Just as any other dayI've been drinking, I been drinking
I'm off that vodka ain't no tellin' what or why
A nigga thinking what he thinking, yeah
Ain't no thoughts all I know is
I won't judge you no I...

My experience
Feel my music, feel my music
It’s a cold-cold-cold world baby
Put on your coat
Preferably, chinchilla mink, know what I mean?
I didn't wanna lie to you
But it sound more fly to you
I didn't wanna lie to you
I swear it sound way fly to you
Cause the truth is gonna hurt you
The truth’s gonna hurt you
I swear the truth’s gonna hurt you
Truth gon' hurt you
I live a cowabunga lifestyle
All these girls around me go wild
And I’m so caught up in my own style
I can’t see you niggas in the crowd
I’m so far, ain’t gonna never come down
You can ask around, I run the town
Every day for me a fashion show
I’m Future Hendrix and I run Pluto
I’m a rockstar forever, I need to get my act together
We’re changin’ up the weather, it’s so hard to be subtle
Since we first got together things changed for the better
I got die hard fans and dey treat me very special
Heard about forty bitches in the lobby
Ask me about it, hold nobody
I didn't wanna lie to you
But it sound more fly to you
I didn't wanna lie to you
I swear it sound way fly to you
Cause the truth is gonna hurt you
The truth’s gonna hurt you
I swear the truth’s gonna hurt you
Truth gon' hurt you
I'm on a the first class flight
Ain't pack a bag overnight
Cause I'ma shop when I land
Yeah, I'ma shop when I land
When you playin’ with them bandz
5 Suite hotel, that's all where we staying
Don’t frustrate and I been up late
 Goin’ over my plans
Feel like sinkin', I'm in sand
Some things you wouldn’t understand
I live the high life, sexing, syrup and money
Everything we do we do it always to the morning
I got a trio, tryna suck me up like Tito
Ain’t fallin’ in lust, you need to trust when I tell you
I didn't wanna lie to you
But it sound more fly to you
I didn't wanna lie to you
I swear it sound way fly to you
Cause the truth is gonna hurt you
The truth’s gonna hurt you
I swear the truth’s gonna hurt you
Truth gon' hurt youDoubled the top knot
Flew out the lattice door
Do what he wouldn’t
Do what he couldn’t do
No lack of ‘wouldn’t’ could be my undoing
No lack of trying
No lack of sighing ‘loo’
Weave songs of loving late
Dream songs of dying
Recite the oakwood flame
Rings count my olden days
I’ve seen the beaches
Breached the peak of ‘please’ and ‘thanks’
I’ve seen my features age
My fingers strange
From the dew
From the dew, of the fields
We grew
And I built a ship for two
It waits for me and you
In the dew of the fields
Is it real?
Is it real?
I’ll show you the way
Just walk beside the low stream until it fades
Into a melon colored field
The wind will know your name
And you don’t have to run
You don’t have to change
Don’t ever change…
We were the candles that lit up the snow on dusty roads
We were the animals breathing life into June just to see faith
Blessed by the cannibal moon and the spoon dipping deep to your nose
Stressed by the distance of shoes and the bridges too far to be named
Was it real?
When we held our hands close to flame
Just to feel
I’ll show you the way
Just walk beside the low stream until it fades
Into a honey colored field
The wind will know your name
And you don’t have to change
You don’t have to change
Love is real
Our love was real
It’s a hand
It’s a hold
It’s a shield
Our love was real
Our love was real
It’s to hope
It’s to dream
It’s to heal
It’s to healPerson - Assalamu alaikum, William, how are you William?

And parting hearts
A dress of leaves blows to the winds
Take these sacrificial remnants—untended
Bashed to dust
And trust distressed
Red cheeks—caved in
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
Cuz all we know, is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
Don't grieve anymore
Cuz all I hold, is all I own
Is this a desperate wish for dying?
Or a wish that dying cease?
The fear that keeps me going and going and going
Is the same fear that brings me to my knees
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
Cuz what was gold, is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
I won't grieve anymore
Cuz all we are, is bled and gone
I am the air, the after
Always in the clouds
Searching for some answer
Parted now, I am the shore—repeated
Becoming air
I'm finally free
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
What I can't see, can't hold to me
I don't believe anymore
I won't grieve anymore
Cuz what was gold, is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
Cuz what was gold, is gone and cold
I don't believe anymore
Don't believe anymore
I won't grieve anymore
Won't grieve anymore

Woah, woah, woahYo, Mike G, nigga  Man, shit nigga I'm just chillin', yo
No, I'm about to hook up with this bitch, she fine as hell nigga 
Hell yeah nigga she fat as hell nigga 
Shit nigga I was walkin my swag and I saw the bitch eatin', right?
She was done with the food, so you know, you know, I just walked up to her
And I just decided to ask her if she wanted something to eat nigga
I pick her up old school street sweeper
Ask her wanna eat she suggest pizza
Shorty got body she from little Puerto Rica
Said her cousin Lisa was at the bar with margaritas
She got a skirt leg tone stallion
Mi piace, but she didn't want Italian
We ride around cruisin', bumpin' old schools
I take back to 90's to bust an old move
I told her I can cook like an arm and a foot
Attached to the leg handcuffed to the bed
Take it to the house curious conversation
Unlock the door we committin' condensation
Hellbound horn sex baby I'm satan
I fuck shit up when up shit is vacant
By the time we use the bed I don't wanna get on
Unless you pull me out and suck right after she spit on
Told you I'mma feed you, told you I'mma feed you
Mouth fulla HB is what call indeed food
Told you I would feed you I told you I would feed you
And she looked at me like "Yeah I agree too"
My high's comin' down, I'm hungry
I finna to get somethin' to eat
Nuttin' too expensive but none too cheap
I dial up shorty number see if she wanna eat
I told her I'll feed you girl, I'll supply the food
What if I just let you starve, wouldn't I be rude?
I'll feed you girl, I'll supply the food
What if I just let you starve, wouldn't I be rude?
She pretty sweet, your new girl is my new treat
Kitchen or dining room damn right I give her a feast
She got an appetite that can't be soothed with regular food
She only fuck with me cause I ain't a regular dude
She ain't a regular bitch, and no need to be rude
She on some other shit, fuckin' another bitch
Hell naw I ain't asked but she ain't gon' say no
First was 5th ave, tore down Rodeo
Told you I'd feed you, told you I'd feed you
Mouth fulla Mike G exactly what you need boo
Told you I'd feed you, told you I'd feed you
Looked me in the eyes with a face that agreed too
Face to face as we shoot up in the room
Reach in my pocket, pull out a fist of shroom
Now you faded off the high life high tip
Now you 'bout to suck on my fuckin' dick, bitch
As we look around the room off the shrooms
Odd Future faces start to turn into goons
Radical, we ate your body cold
Fuck the microwave I eat it like this, yo
Ha-ha, that bitch though I was gonna feed her
Turnt out I feed the fuckin' crew know what I'm sayin'

My auntie's house was a dope house and I slung dope in my longjohns
My grandma seen me bust a plate, put 30 stacks on 4 squares

But just go right in the booth, and spit my heart and my anger
My closest friends givin' up, man they feelin' like strangers

You gotta take me on a high speed chase before you catch me
You either live, you either die, that's the only way you'll get me
Aww man, aww man, I should have stayed at Columbia High
It was times that I thought "What I'm thinkin', like why
I am who I am?" and shit I can't cry

And it's a lot of money in the room
I gotta find another spot, hiding soon
I mix the rosé with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop

Finessin', we came up from nothin'
Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we went from rags to riches
Whipping up that Frank Lucas, cooking up that Young Poochie
Beamer coup with a clear view, got 'Rari with the clear view
Trapped out, I'm on CNN, spaceship I done went to Mars
Gotta model bitch who can take the dick, got a gutter bitch who can take a charge
Went to Paris on a weekday, and I'm coming back in a couple months
Everyday I wake up, I'm drinking lean, I'm smoking blunts
Dropped out of my high school, then I went and copped me a drop top
Got residue on my dreadlocks, my whole style unorthodox
Trading in my hand scale, started selling them big bells
30 bricks by 30 bricks, I could sell a nigga some oatmeal
Sell a nigga some horse feed, cashing out for a hundred pounds
Sell a nigga some A-1, I'll cook it up for you right now
Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we came up from nothin'
Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we went from rags to riches
Credit card my swipe game, I strike off like lightning
Fuck with me, my lick game, I'm hitting licks excite me
I'm taking off like MJ, my check game like Nike
Anytime I get that cash, that cash make me hyphy
I'm jumping off my products, stacking up my dollars
I stay chasing that guala, ain't no turning up my collar
Represent my city, nigga want game gotta pay pesos
That pink inside my Styrofoam, got yellow bones on my iPhone
Running up like a treadmill, conversation gotta pay bills
Everything I wear nigga is Ferragamo in public
High top Margiela's, thousand dollars for a sweater
Money talk no pressure, everything disrespectful
Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we came up from nothin'
Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin', Finessin'
Finessin', we went from rags to richesI’ve broken many promises
But this one I would die to keep
When I said I’d be there tomorrow
Beside you as you sleep
I was scared, cuz I’ve lost so many things before
Kept me running from the world and from myself
You gave me second chance and hopes to run to
I couldn’t bare to spend — another day without you
I’ve gotta catch you
Freezing rain can’t keep me away
From your door, from your door
What if the sun don’t shine?
Well then the birds won’t sing
Just then the blizzard came
Covered you, half a world away
Now I’m stuck in this place, without you
Thinking—what should I do?
All I knew—I couldn’t wait—one more night
And if this plane won’t fly
Then I’ll drive…
'Cause I’ve gotta catch you
Freezing rain can’t keep me away, from you
I’m gonna catch you
Blinding snow can’t keep me away
From your door, from your door
What if the sun don’t shine
Well then the birds won’t sing
Just then the blizzard came
Covered you, half a world away, a world asleep
And I was scared
Cuz I’ve lost so many things before
Kept me running—from the world—and from myself
You gave me second chance and hopes to run to
I couldn’t bare to spend—another day without you
Cuz I’ve gotta catch you
Freezing rain can’t keep me away, from you
I’ve gotta find you
Hurricanes can’t keep me away….from you
Fire and chains can’t keep me away…from you
Falling planes can’t keep me away…from you
From you…
From youCatch me laughing
Catch me drinking past the dawn
Catch me singing
Catch me beaming—open armed
Don’t watch me weeping
Don’t watch me weep into my palms
Don’t watch me leaving, I’ll be gone
Kiss me mother, Kiss me father
Fore I go
Don’t want to leave you
But I’m sorry... I can’t hold
And you see me, through the roses
Through the lights and the smoke and the screen
I’m no one better
I’m no better than you and I'm scared
Just searching for truth
It’s not easy, just being human
And the lights and the smoke and the screens
Don’t make it better
I’m no stronger than you and I’m scared
I don't know what to do
I’m scared
That I can’t pull through
In the weak of my soul
The temptation to look inside my wrist—it grows
The cut is waiting
The cut is waxing in its hold
The clutch of nothing
The curse of wanting
Takes me whole
And you see me, through the roses
Through the lights and the smoke and the screen
I’m no one better
I’m no better than you and I’m scared
Just searching for truth
It’s not easy, just being human
And the lights and the smoke and the screens
Don’t make it better
I’m no stronger than you and I’m scared
I don't know what to do
I’m scared
But we can pull through—together
Together
We can pull throughBetter hope you die a gangster, gangster, gangsta

Young niggas in they 30's talkin' 'bout they retirin'Left out on the road eight years ago
And you left too but I never really thought you would really go
If I knew then—I’s really losing you
I’d change my ways and my mind—fore I lose control
Cuz in a darkened space, we watched our souls replace
And said our ‘goodbyes’
But we didn’t know the shape
And for years now
I been hunting you down
Trying to find out
Your hiding place
Oh, at last!
You’re here in my arms again
And I don’t know how long
So I won’t waste a bit
The beauty of the road—is lost in your eyes—I drift
Softly back to when, we were young and in love
Where does it go?
You spend your whole life wishing and working all you gets the end of the rope
Oh what do we know?
You spend your whole life searching and find the thing you’re looking is what you lost so long ago
And for years now, I’ve been hunting the sound
That soft breath on the back of my neck, got me running…
Oh, at last!
You’re here in my arms again
And I don’t know how long
So I won’t waste a bit
The beauty of the road—is lost in your eyes—I drift
Softly back to when, we were young and in love
You’re here in my arms again
And I don’t know how long
So I won’t waste a bit
The beauty of the road—is lost in your eyes—I drift
Softly back to when, we were young and in love
Oh we were young
And in love
I was young
And in loveAye

Extravagant lifestyle

Them presidential Benz's, you can tell I'm doing numbers
They jocked a nigga style and they had turned me to a monster
I was swaggign to the max, I had to turn it to some commas

I'm eatin five-star dinners, living like my nigga Stunna

It's gonna be hard to turn me down
I'm a motherfuckin star and it ain't hard for me to shine Under bad signs we were born
Into families that had sworn up and down
They would keep us safe
Yeah, okay
And I'm classically sad and I'm inclined to get mad
And I dwell upon mistakes that I've made
It keeps me awake at night
The realization that I might be a drag
That no one wants to inhale
Don't leave me here, where my fears
Consume my thoughts, of what was
And what could have been, it's a sin
That I threw it all away
When I hurt myself again
Yeah, I hurt myself again
When I hurt myself again
I'll pretend it's just an accident
'Til I hurt myself again
Yeah, I hurt myself again
When I hurt myself again
I'll admit I got problems
Yeah, show me someone who don't
Most of the time
I'm convinced that I survived
And that's fine
But it's far from ideal, but I'll deal
I wish that I had all the things that they have
So I could feed this void in my chest
'Cause kids are so unkind
To kids of different kinds
And I promise that I'm not okay
Don't leave me here, where my fears
Consume my thoughts, of what was
And what could have been, it's a sin
That I threw it all away
Just to hurt myself again
Yeah, I hurt myself again
When I hurt myself again
And l pretend it's just an accident
'Til I hurt myself again
Yeah, I hurt myself again
When I hurt myself again
I'll admit I got problems
Woah, woah
Woah, oh
Woah, woah
Woah, oh
Please don't leave my sight
Give me all the love you have
I need it more than air in my lungsYeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
Shit'll never be the same no more
I know cheated a million times
And you caught me in so many lies
Shit'll never be the same no more
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no more
I was standing in the rain in the middle of the trenches
Running from polices, jumping over fences
Serving in the them hotboxes living life relentless
Taking penitentiary chances still dodging the penitentiary
The teachers taught my cousins go to school and you done listen
Make your outlook on life different, damn you look suspicious
My granddad died a boss, and that's been on my memory
If you listen closer to me, feel the pain in my delivery
The struggle and the pain, I still remain the same
I'm grinding so hard I'm just strengthening up my brain
Flyer then the plain, moving faster then the train
Get the fuck up out my lane, some things gotta change
After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
Shit'll never be the same no more
I know cheated a million times
And you caught me in so many lies
Shit'll never be the same no more
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no more
Damn it feel like yesterday I'm at the corner store
When the po-po ran up on me in Mexico
I dropped the blow I swear I never ran that fast before
And when I play it back in my memory in the studio
I swear I grind and I grind going hard every time
Going hard on my grind
Selling damaged bricks, shit be at a bunch of licks
I write a hundred songs every time I think of this
Take a 2 liter fill it up with codeine
Let's take a toast to all my niggas who ain't here with me
And I'm a ride I'm a ride
Until the rubber off the tires, only the strong survive
After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
Shit'll never be the same no more
I know cheated a million times
And you caught me in so many lies
Shit'll never be the same no more
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no more
My glasses made from Germany, designer on me permanently
These scars on me permanently, this pain insides burning me
But it ain't killing me, It's boosting up my energy
I'm on my way to Tennessee, doing a show for 10 a key
And these streets they're a beast out here
I don't plan on coming home I might leave you this year
And shawty I know you ride for a nigga
But you get tired of a nigga, tired of crying over your nigga
So many lies, so many broken promises
I hate it come to this, I took you through a bunch of shit
Feel good to your side, I tried to buy you a bunch of shit
But you don't take it no more, you sick and tired of it
After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
Shit'll never be the same no more
I know cheated a million times
And you caught me in so many lies
Shit'll never be the same no more
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no moreI take my licks - like a man
Facing forward
I made my bed, it wasn't yours
How soon we'd forget - what we shared
You said you'd always be mine
I nodded and smiled
Tongue out of my head
Is this love?
Or the love of the chase?
Is this love?
Is this love?
Or the love of the chase?
Tell me now, is it love?
We did the best that we can
Across the world
We made a plan, it wasn't yours
How soon we'd forget - what we shared
In folding sands
Our castle, no more
The magic - sleight of hand
Is this lover?
Or the love of the chase?
I had you once, you kept forgetting my name
Is this love?
Or the love of the chase?
What was your name?
Was it something like me, me, me?
We recede in the fog
As to breathe in this calm
And forget this walk
To leave, you and all
We were more than the fall
And I hope you'd agree
Like sunlight through the fog
Always chasing me
Lil bluebell in shade - what was your name?
Was it something like me?
Lil bluebell in shade

It ain't always like it seemMy window opens on your heart
Yet shadows divide our worlds with loss
The light setting, in the corner of my room
Isn't enough, but is it for you?
A melody that trails and falls, yet never fully blooms
Plays like an old song
That’s just out of tune
Why can't you just break free?
Is it the heat dreams, that fevers brought you?
These old shadows 
They turn me like a screw
And dance the dance of Dante, entreating you
They're just shadows 
Won't let me get close to you
I'm walking a ghost, through the Garden of Eden’s ruins
The light setting, in the corner of my room
Plays like an old song that's just out of tune
A melody that trails and falls yet never fully blooms
Is it enough? well is it for you?
Why won't you just take me?
Is it the bee's sting that honey haunts you?
Is it the sweet things you fear--you'll lose
If I get near, to you?
Before we’re through…
These old shadows 
Parade you like a fool, you’re living in dust
While a ghost hangs coats on you
These old shadows 
Crotcheted and trembling, nude
I’m walking a ghost but I wanna walk next to you
I wanna break through to you
The light setting in the corner of my room
Isn’t enough, well is it for you?
The light setting, in the corner of your room
It’s more than enough, for me and for you
For me and for youHave you ever smoked alone
On a summer night
2AM
On the docks, overnight
You
When they bust you for the weed girl
Dont tell your parents
I used to smoke you up all night, ay
When the beat dropped
You know I be going off under the mic
Oku naga, Oku naga
Oku naga geku
Wocky Wocky with the lights off
Girl you wanna tell me where the lights are
Girl you telling me you want the lights off
Lights off, lights off, girl
When you with me it's all systems go, systems go
When you're not around me
I will let you know, let you know
Girl, I know you
I seen you once and then I seen you twice
Couldn't get my eyes off you
I talked to you and you wanted me, girl
The rest was all a story as we
Moved in motion on the limb of an ocean
When you
Open your heart up
I found a tiny treasure in you
I found comfort in silence with you
Oku naga geku
Wocky Wocky with the lights off
Girl you wanna tell me where the lights are
Girl you telling me you want the lights off

Two tennis necklace these ain't PF Chang'sAncient like the water
Dissolves my selfish leanings and all the others
Guide me
You beside me
With conviction—my lost invention
My child is starving
But you keep me, you keep me
I’ve been locked and you’re the key
You keep me, you keep me
You keep me ’til I’m ready to be free
Too many wasted days and nights
Obsessed with the flickering bits of my life
Forgetting what giving and living can be—what it can mean
First forgiving myself and stepping outside of my own apathy
To see, I just want to be
Patient like the forest
Stood through thousands fallen
Watched the changing evening a million times or more
Lead me to the water
Take me to the other side
And know how much it means, to me
Cuz you keep me, you keep me
I’ve been locked and you’re the key
Too many wasted days and nights
Obsessed with the flickering bits of my life
I’ve forgotten what giving and living can be—what it can mean
First steps to being better is doing the smallest things
Cuz you keep me, you keep me
You keep me I’ve been locked and you’re the key
You keep me, you keep me
You keep me ’til I’m strong enough to see
To be free To saintly hallelujah, yeah man
With a little bit of love
And it came from nothing
It's hard to get a grip
When you don't even know what love is 
You look up and it's gone
Now, you're chasing something
Can someone make me feel
Someone make me feel like you did? 
And I'm lost, living on a prayer
Wishing you were here
So come on home
And I'm done, I'm done with all this pain
Since you're taking everything away
It's not the same, oh-no-no-no
I guess I'm still missing ya'
I hate that you're the only one I'm thinking of
Can't get away from ya'
Everything reminds me of you
Now, is it too late for us?
I wanna pick it up where we left it once
All I wanna know, would it feel like before?
Am I crazy to crave this love?
I imagine waking up
In a room with nothing
And all I want is us
But I'm not even sure how you feel 
So I'm lost, living on a prayer
Wishing you were here
So come on home
And I'm done, I'm done with all this pain
Since you're taking everything away
It's not the same, oh-no-no-no
I guess I'm still missing ya'
I hate that you're the only one I'm thinking of
Can't get away from ya'
Everything reminds me of you
Now, is it too late for us?
I wanna pick it up where we left it once
All I wanna know, would it feel like before?
Am I crazy to crave this love?
Next time I feel this I won't let it go
Made my mistake 'til you reap what you sow
Staring at the ceiling like every night
Like every night 
I guess I'm still missing ya'
I hate that you're the only one I'm thinking of
Can't get away from ya'
Everything reminds me of you
Now, is it too late for us?
I wanna pick it up where we left it once 
All I wanna know, would it feel like before?
Am I crazy to crave this love?Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!

Candor, uneven - in it's will to find
The right design
The form belongs, to no one
Holding truth
Come see me through
Come through the sea
To bare
And share
The light inside of you
Don't cast away, Don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Be more than words
Be more than strength and kind
Be love and blind
To those who come to you
Sing something new
Belief is wet and ghost
Yet, loves the most of what we do
Don't cast away, don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
And open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you
Those winter days
Those winter nights
Those days and those nights
Come see me through
Come through the sea
To bare
And share
The light inside of you
Don't cast away, Don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you
Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth

I’m ‘bout to spend me some chips, I won’t regret it
I put in weight from the deck, I’m driving reckless
You can’t be hacking the player, you get a penalty 
I get to dozing off in the coupe off promethazine
You put a turbo next to a turbo, that’s royalty
Represent loyalty

The movieThere's way too much on my mind
To give you all my time
But I know there’s something wrong
There's no justice in photographs
Such lovely eyes you have, that cry yourself to sleep
I got so scared last night
I couldn't breathe, I was paralyzed
I got so sad last night
My eyes deprived of the light you shine
I couldn’t see your dark
You gave me butterflies
Pinned to the sides of my stomach line
Your kiss is filled with fire
It charred my lips and my sense of pride
The way we twist and twine
If love is blind, cross out my eyes
I won't mind at all
'Cause some might say
That better days
Are on their way, but they lie
If suffering is beautiful
Then you're the most beautiful
Mirage these eyes could ever meet
And you made my fever spike
And I put up quite the fight
That I never planned to win
I got so scared last night
I couldn't breathe, I was paralyzed
I got so sad last night
My sight deprived of the light you shine
I couldn't see your dark
You gave me butterflies
Pinned to the sides of my stomach line
Your kiss is filled with fire
It charred my lips and my sense of pride
The way we twist and twine
Love is blind, it took both my eyes
I don't mind at all
And some might say, that better days
Are on their way but they're not
Oh, yeah
Is there anyone out there?
Send me a sign, turn water to wine
Lord knows
I need a kiss, don’t leave me like this
Hell no
You’re bought and I'm sold
You’re giving me cold sweats, sweats
You brought me a reason to live, I traded my soul
I tasted apocalypse and I needed more
As you kill me, make me ill baby, please
I never wanted a curse on my tongue 'til youLeaves are turning to the end
Of a picture perfect scene
To a lifestyle paved with greed, oh no
Autumn, oh autumn
You let me down, when you came around, oh no
Cause I don’t wanna live my last days out in sorrow
I don’t wanna live my last days out in sorrow
I don’t wanna wake up to the cold of tomorrow, no
Mama, sweet mama
Hear me out, I’m moving out
I can’t wait to leave this town behind and move away
Far away and I won’t forget this day is where that-
One day's night, I promised you would witness
How I could change the world
Yes, I’ve fallen, I’ve fallen
I can’t get up
Do you will get up
Yes, I’ve fallen, I’ve fallen
I can’t get up
Do you will get up
I will get up
When you found me in the dark
Left me stranded for the ark
You always said you’d be there for me
Well friendships always wither
Like tulips in the winter
But the summers almost over and I still ain’t got no closure from you
You would never change but you wanted me to
Bitch I wish I could be back to sober you
And another one, and another one, and another one’s gone
We don’t get along, no we don’t really ever get along
Let's just ride around
Cassie on repeat, it's just you and me
Let's just ride around
Egotistical fell in love at seventeen
How did I
How did I fall back then
Now that I, now that I found myself
If you fell in love with the wrong person, just remind yo'self
That you gotta fall in love with the wrong person
Just to find yourselfDamn, it's open season
On my people and the reason
Is if you don't make the treason
We gon' give you books and visas

And you dap me up and you said you're up
And I said nah, but I got a hit in Europe

Find a way, we can find a way
At least today, we can be most anything
Float away, we can float away
Far away from everything
Dust to dust and face to face
I'm ashamed of what remains in me
You gotta bleed
To make me believe
Pain hides my scent, yeah
I need a brand new shadow
When dust makes dust and our faces meet
I disconnect from every string you tied to me
I bask in silence, want you to notice
Simple yet complex, ventricle taste test

Break the rulesAnd it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, you are who you are
And when you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold as your heart, you as cold as your heart
I keep that same mentality when I was facing casualties
Goin’ through my tragedies, I practice like a athlete
Wouldn’t believe the half of me
Show and prove, don’t make believe
I’ll make you believe, all my thoughts free
Purer than the rawest coke
This ain’t no shit that I wrote
I’ve been down this road before
And I’ve been on the rollercoast’
So many ups and downs and turns
Homies droppin’ like flies
Full strapped forty times
Doin' a life sentence and he died
While I’m on the road, doin’ shows, takin’ this ride
I just got word my uncle tried commit suicide
This the second time I’m goin’ back in, the second time
You’ll get a second chance at life, nigga I ain’t lyin’
And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
I gots the homies, they could only mean the world to me
And they ain’t comin’ back home, they in the cemetery 
I wish I made this up, it was a fairytale
I know the kingpin’s on, the name is Legendary
They smoke crack right now, this ain’t a Tyler Perry
This real rap, real life, it’s very necessary
For me to go on in, so I went back in
Wish I could stay in this booth and never come out again
My lil’ cousin caught a body and he’s still fightin’
And I got killaz walkin’ the yard, Future all they recitin’
And I can’t forget you niggas did too much biting
But I ain’t gon' hold no grudge, I just know your type
And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
I take a trip, unwrap a gift, run ithere like Emmit Smith
Go to New York with this gift and I come back with a lick
Break bread with my team
Partner money here, here
I ain't come for this, I want my music global
I wanna see people pump their fist
I’m gonna change a nigga life
So he ain’t gotta go through this
Don’t get caught in my fit
Till I’m runnin’ 1 0 6
They tracked me ‘cross the globe
You can have the fame
Just give me my soul
I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat
Before I lose my respect
I stick to the code
I hold a tol on my shoulder
But I will never fold
No snitches allowed, case closed
And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heartI'm stainless
Tempered by earth and flame
Mixed with time and pain
Ingrained with higher purpose know the worth of my name
And the product I done came with
Not blameless for the straps and the dope that I hold
The sacks that I sold
Kept my baby out the cold and her belly full of food
And her back never lacking of clothes
This game is so grimy it's impossible to win with your innocence intact
Matter of fact it deranges
The person that you wanted to remain intrinsically changes
We can actualize but our actual lives are affected by a hunger for sane-ness
In the back of our minds are the nastiest lines that a dope emcee never came with
Once we get tired of fakin', unchain the beast in the brain that awakens
See the clear path that I used to couldn't see
Be the kind of artist that I thought I couldn't be
Become that man that'd rather die standing than ever live head down bending a knee
So I purify my soul in the land of the fire
My sweat and my tears dull pain
And the blood that I leave on the battlefield proves what I've always known
I was born to reignShe looks like the moon
She says, "it's your eyes"
She sees everything
She knows me too well
And she looks like the day
She says, "it's the light"
Something in the way she says "goodbye"
And she looks like the moon
So close and, yet, so far
She says everything
She knows me too well
And I can call you "friend"
And I can be the world
Silent chatter held
I won't be around
And I can be a friend
But I won't be around
Silent chatter, bound
Just don't push me out!
And she looks like the moon
She says, "it's your eyes"
She says everything
She knows me too well
And I can call you "friend"
But I won't be around
Silent chatter, bound
Just don't push me out...
We don't have to speak tonight
Just don't say "goodbye"
Making a home in my body
Letting it grow in my body
Taking these chains from my body
Letting it go from my body
Letting it go from my body
Taking these chains from my body
Is harder than you know
Oh!
And she looks like the moon
She says, "it's your eyes"
She says everything
She knows me too well
And she looks like the day
She says, "it's the light"
Something in the way she says, "goodbye"
Just don't say goodbye
I can be the world, tonightPensive and quiet
Like forever was
In a chrysalis, she waits for us
And she takes from us
Oh sweet life, why give and take from us?
It's all for you
It's all for truth
Feels like I'm holding you down
But you won't leave me alone
And you're holding me now
But I'm so far away from you
There's no home
No home like the one I found in you
Now you're running away
Oh, to feel like a child again...
And the song he sings, he brings to life for you
It's all for you
It's all for you...
And he words he places on the page just can't admit
This song's for you
This song's for you...
Feels like you're holding me down
But I can't leave you alone
And I'm holding you now
But you're so far and lost to me
There's no home
No home like the one I found in you
Now I'm running away
And I feel like a child again
Oh, to feel like a child again...
And I'm haunted by you
I'm haunted by you
Every song I sing, it brings me back to you
Cause I'm haunted by you
I'm haunted by you
I'm haunted by you...Call it how it is

No longer a guest in your bed
Or in your heart or head
Surrounded by your things and memories entire
Not finding any trace of me

We used to walk, we used to run
We used to talk until the sun come up
We used to walk, we used to run
I packed my bags last night

But I had to come and see that this had died
I had to look into your eyes
Just one last time
Just one last time
Oh I had to look into your eyes!

Oh Your love for all mankind
Every step that You were taking
Was a step in place of mine
Oh the scars that You endured
Oh the weight of painful sin
Was salvation for this world
To begin again
It was sin that separated
But Your blood has brought me near
You became God and man among us
To repair my brokenness
This is undeserved affection
I'm a trophy of Your grace
Overwhelmed by Your forgiveness
There's no equal love
Just the cross
It's enough
Just the cross
It's enough
When darkness had its moment
And death thought that he had won
Still Your perfect plan in motion
For the world that You so love
On the third, You rose again
Oh Your power conquered death
So that I could live forever
Hallelujah

Yeah we stay faded(We create a new sound to kill the old sound
We open old wounds to flood the room
We create a new sound to kill the old sound
We open old wounds to flood the room)
Whoo!
Oh, looking back, there’s nothing for me there
And standing still is just more than I can bear
That outside world will only cut your throat
And your hometown is just hoping you'll implode
I'm scared of shadows from my past
They loom large until there's light
I never thought that I could be happy
I just know I can't admit I'm not
We're overfed 'til the seams are bursting
I'm still starved for the love I never got
Scared of shadows from your past
They're looming large until there's light
And I can see the birds of prey circling overhead
And they might strip our bones and I might long for it
For it, for it, for it
Never meant to say "I'm sorry"
Just hate to hear an awkward pause
Unmarked, my feelings get buried
Up to my throat 'til I can't talk
I'm scared of shadows from my past
They're looming large until there's light
And I see the birds of prey circling overhead
And they might strip our bones and I might long for it
For it
There's nothing wrong with me
I've given everything
There's nothing left in my heart
I've used up everything
And I see the birds of prey circling overhead, oh yeah
And they might strip our bones
And sell the rest for scrap, oh yeah
And you might hear my words
But you can never truly know
'Cause these scars are my own
And I earned every one
You might hope someday
That a tiger's stripes will change
Oh, but, girl, I gotta say
That plan don't sound worth a fuck
(We create a new sound to kill the old sound
We open old wounds to flood the room
We create a new sound to kill the old sound
We open old wounds to flood the room)I've been here before, so proud yet insecure
And it's sad to realize that we used to get high
But now we just get down
What washed up on the shore was unrecognizable
To the crowds gathered 'round
Try to expose what they found
But they never understood
If you wanna believe in something
It's that nothing lasts forever
If you wanted to fight for something
Start a war against time passing by
And the pale in your eyes
That still can't hold my gaze
We weathered every storm
But we're shattered at the core
And it breaks my heart to doubt who you are
But I'll try and keep the faith
If you wanna believe in something
It's that nothing lasts forever
If you wanted to fight for something
Start a war against time passing by
And the pale in your eyes
That still can't hold my gaze
If you wanna believe in something
It's that nothing lasts forever
If you wanna believe in something
It's that nothing lasts forever
It's that nothing lasts forever
If you wanted to fight for something, start with us
'Cause it kills me to know
That we used to feel low
But now you just lay down
Oh, and it's time that we all stood up
If you wanna believe in something
It's that nothing lasts forever
If you wanted to fight for something, start with us
I just wanna believe in something
I just wanna believe in somethingMine all mine
Wander
Away we go
Over lines
I won't let go, she knows why
She feeds my soul

No glance to steal
No thrill from my touch
It kills me to feel the ghost
Of what we once embraced
There's no tell in your face
Although I can tell
There's no talk on your lips
Just the taste of his
And the gall it took to boast
While you burned our bridges down
Now, I know how all of this goes
Before the words come tumbling out
And I've felt the pain that you gave in spades
But I'll go to the end of the Earth
If it means I'll end up with you
Yeah, I'll cross the distance you aim to create
No love from your love
No kiss and tell
No fucks to give, love
Just one last farewell, in the form
Of a fragile poem
That promptly turns to dust
Yeah, I know how all of this goes
Before the words come tumbling out
And I've felt the pain that you gave in spades
And I'll go to the end of the Earth
If it means I'll end up with you
Yeah, I'll cross the distance you aim to create
Framed as last goodbyes
24/7, 24/7
24/7, I hate my love for you
24/7, 24/7
24/7, I hate my love for you
24/7, 24/7
24/7, I hate my love for you
24/7, 24/7, 24/7, 24/7
Yeah, I know how all of this goes
Before the words come tumbling out
And I've felt the pain that you gave in spades
And I'll go to the end of the Earth
If it means I'll end up with you
Yeah, I'll cross the distance you aim to create

But you better respect my fears 'cause
And I know I don’t have to explain myself to you
But I might feel better if I try
So, let's tell you something
There’s a part of me that’s not sure if I’m here
There's a definite part of me that don’t believe in the now, yeah
And that’s just the start of it
'Cause I ain't convinced you’re all real
There might be an art to it but
I don’t think I got the skill, and
Bless your heart, you don’t know how I feel
I’ll do my part, and try to explain, oh
And yeah, you might be smart
But you don’t know how this feels
Yeah, no matter the words in your heart
You can keep 'em
‘Cause this life is like doing time when you’re dead inside
I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like before
I don’t want to settle the score
I don’t wanna die here
I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don’t wanna feel like before
I don’t want to settle the score
I don’t wanna die
Sometimes, I get so low
That I swear I could cry
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer for me now, oh
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer for me
Say a little prayer for me now
Bless your heart, yeah, you don’t know how I feel
I’m doing my part, I try to explain
Over and over and over again
Yeah, you might be smart
But you don't know how this feels
Yeah, no matter the words in your heart, you can keep 'em, oh
‘Cause this life, girl
Yeah, this life is making a fucking fool out of me, oh
No one can tell me if it's just my fucking mind
Playing dirty tricks on me
I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like before
I don’t want to settle the score
I don’t wanna die here
I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like before
I don’t want to settle the score
I don’t wanna die here
I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don't wanna feel like I did
I just wanna know
I don’t wanna hurt no more
I don’t wanna feel like I did
I just wanna live
Yeah, sometimes, oh
Sometimes, I get so low that I swear, baby
I just can't figure out which way is up, oh, yeah
And these things that I’m seeing
They combat what I’m feeling
And I just need to know I’ve really survivedUnimpressed by the ignorance we choose to commend

See, you deserve a night off and I know what to do with itOur hearts need work, I'm scared we’re born to lose
Tired of acting tough when I should've known better
And our words get stuck so we taught ourselves to smile
Yours shines so bright that it makes me shiver
Just when you thought it can't get worse, always it does
Just when you thought it can’t get worse, always it does
We ignored the signs, got lost for miles and miles
Know what buttons to push with both middle fingers
And I'm out of touch, and your ticks are out of time
Couldn't wait to get gone, you're a real go-getter
Just when you thought it can't get worse, always it does
Just when you thought I can't get worse, I'm off my meds
I'm wondering is it me, is it me that made you feel so sad?
I miss you so much, I miss you sober
I hope you don’t mind
I miss you so much, I miss you sober
I hope you don’t mind
I won't call
Is it me, is it me that brings you down?
My heart needs work, it does what it wants to do
Keeps falling, oh, when I should’ve known better
And my words get stuck so I taught myself to smile
So sick of us, I hope I never get betterSkee!

Uh, 600 days no sleep, nigga

Uh, knew my day would come, I was past done
Upper echelon, call it a icon, what's done is doneLead not for loss
And you’ll bleed not for long
Lost in streets, unnamed by your fate
Go unplayed, all the records, you’ve reclaimed
But it’s easy, in the winter
Where the white smoke
Rises slow like finding, something waiting
Where no one goes
It makes a sound like dying
Was it trying to say
“I’d give you all and diamonds, just for one more replay”
Just one chance to say
Keep me close, I’ll never weep
My love’s asleep
I’ve kept it close and guarded tight
From dead of night
And laid a cross of iron dross upon my door
The way you laid across our bed some time before
In the winter
There’s a black rose
Its beauty, something blinding
Curling wilding
Through the white snow
It makes me feel like diamonds
Was it dying to say
“I’ll give you all but silence, just for one more replay”
Just one chance to say
“As my lover goes my garden grows”
As she looks away I hear her say
“As my garden grows, my lover goes”
“As we look away, I hear him say”
“Stay.”Dont understand
Nah yeah dey dont unserstand

You brought your girl to the club, but she's leaving with us
I'm mashing off in the coupe, getting some head from a slut
And she's catching everything, she won't spit it back up
I bought that bitch some red bottoms, cause she's down for the kid
And she owns so many guns, she's worse than Billy the Kid
I put that semi-automatic in her name and she's with it
When you pull up with that cash, she's going to serve you them fishes

Acking up, acking up, acking up, stacking upI've thought enough for both of us, but I barely said a word
Been back and forth a thousand times hoping not to lose
And I know I should take it slow
But I've never followed suit
And this ache you gave, it dies with me
This time I'm finally through
I wish it wasn't true
And so it goes
I may wish I'd disappear
Let the record slow
As the distance grows, it's like I always feared
I never gave enough and I never wanted to but still I think of you
Would you waste some time on me?
Am I a waste of time?
If you're around next year, even for a day
Would you show your face?
And lay those eyes on me
'Cause I'm a sight to see
I survived so much on my own
That you'll bite your tongue
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We're deaf to those that tell us truths
That we don't wanna hear
So here's to those that wish us well
The rest can go to hell
Life's a waste without you and me
Life's a waste without you and me
I don't wanna be
Yeah, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be that way
Never gettin' rid

Woah, relaxationBeen a long time, in a low place
Surrounded by what I have made
Need to get away
Get away from what relates
And what was done
Cuz it's all over now
Through the woods, I come running to loose leaf
And carve my name
In the lines, there's not a trace
I hear the ghost whisper, and those old eyes watching me
But I feel safe...
Grandfather looking over me
He said:
"Don't make them wait
Gotta go a long way
Let's be brave
Don't make them wait
Nah, don't make them wait"
I sat down, with a coffee on my bent knee
Looking out, at the burnt land, looking back at me
These used to be green crops
And high on a summer breeze
Now it's fallow fields and clear-cut barren weeds
They said that if I stared
The abyss would stare back at me
So I did...
And I felt it slowly creep in me
Save for the smoke, that danced when I took a drag
It made me think about the way it all came to be...
Grandmama watching over me
And she said
"Don't make them wait
Gotta go a long way
Let's be brave, show them the way
Nah, don't make them wait"
Don't make them wait, nah
Don't make them wait
I hear the ghost whisper
And those old eyes watching me
But I feel safe
I feel safeUm, he came on the scene, he's already impacted the scene in a way where a lot of other artists are trying to do exactly what he does and trying to sound just like him. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Future!
Um, that Drunk in Love song, was that your song that Beyoncé and Jay-Z did?
Cause I'm honest, I didn't, when you, they put you on the MTV -uh, what was it-, the top 10 best rappers, I don't know what the number was, I was like 'why is Future on that list?'
Is that, is that, I might've mistaken, I might've read it wrong. I might've seen a one before the five. Is that a fifteen-carat diamond ring?You have no idea what it take
Hard work
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
You would work for everything you get
If you knew what it took
[Verse 1: Future
All them nights in platinum, throwin up the cash
Studio session after session I get it back
All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took

I lost a baby mama and a good girl behind that
I'm standing in the middle of the rain
Trying to wash off this pain
And when them drops stopped
That's when I come to my senses and I finally realized
I'm scarred for life, and fuck the hype I go hard for life
Ain't it precious, I'm thankful
For every second I'm in the leather room
My phone up, actin like a piston
You so caught in the present
You don’t wanna stay down for your prison
You bout that drama, drama, I want that llama, llama
Behind these raps behind that trap I ask my baby mama
Go see my vision, my dreams maybe too big for you
You better thank god everyday I had a kid by you
All them nights in platinum
Throwin up the cash
Studio session after session I hit it back
All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
If you knew what it took
You would work for everything you get
I lost a baby mama and a good girl behind that
I'm standing in the middle of the rain
Trying to hide the tears running down my face
And when them drops stopped
I come to my senses and I go hard for my block
Kirkwood for life, Lil Mexico I got so many stripes
I coulda went to war twice andcame back nice
With a few scratches all I need is some green plastic
And I go morherfuckin get that cash
I'm a survivor, with plenty fashion
And a whole lotta soul with my voice raspy
I'm gonna try to spit my lung up
When the sun down till it come up, find a way to come up
All them nights in platinum
Throwin up the cash
Studio session after session I hit it back
All them trips we took, now I put money on your book
All them licks I hit so I can invest in my hits

The future is now
Time and space are one in the same
Enough time in space and we running the game
Almost is unacceptable
The cosmos is a receptacle
For the spectacle of my ascension
Inhabiting multiple dimensions of perspective
All my actions selective
At all costs, I must obtain the objective
Regain the inception intended at the conception
A living lethal weapon
I'm the natural selection
Moving in my own eccentric orbit
A rebel amongst conformists
So far gone, you might catch me on Pluto
4 billion miles away
Do a whole week in one day
Live for keeping it real, you already know what it is
I rarely ever speak without something to say
But if you can't remember the who, what, when, or the how
Remember one thing I said: the future is nowI got a couple good friends
I got a couple good friends, yeah
I got a couple good friends

Try to blame me
Did ya, did ya, did ya
Little Brady told me you was plottin' on me

Praise to my good friends, yeah
Love to my good friends, yeah

Didn't mean to go out my way to hurt you
And I'm sorry

I got a couple good friends, yeah
I got a couple good friends, yeah

And they holding me down
When I'm feeling right down, yeahWhen I was down and out

You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies, Ahhhh
More money more problems, man this shits hilarious

Once you get the fame, it’s consequences that come with it
Sometimes you wanna wake up and just say I’m done with it
You know all these dudes I paid
Now you do the most complaining
Now I made it and I’m famous
Emotionally you drain me
I smoke a pound of that kush
And blow out the stress I’m thinking
I put versace on leather cover me like a blanket
I sip on codeine, I’m sippin it till my body numb
And I get loaded like baby gangster vl shawty
Remember shoppin at linnicks, I let you hold the 40
I’m a superstar and now you wish you can take it from me
When I was down and out
You always showed me love, ahhh
Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, hannn
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies,Ahhhh
Getting high, drinking, smoking, rolling up the purple
And I swear to god it'll hurt me more to hurt you
Grinding, hustling we ain't never take no nights off
Money came flipping, switching, tryna cut my lights off
Fight and make up, shoes, 1000 on the make-up
Pouring drank, to hold me down like an ankle
Tunnel vision on that money, fuck that talk
In the club, twisting fingers, getting twisted
Off that dark, water
We was down and out, we had to plan it out
Me and shawty getting ghost, spoil the phantom out
Quarter million on the car, silk medusa sheets
Before I made a dollar, I was lying to the streets
When I was down and out
You always showed me love, ahhh
Until we woke up, getting high, smoking lalaa, hannn
When I was down and out
You always showed me love
Until we woke up, getting high, telling lies,AhhhhOne more night in solitude
Removed from everyone
Even if I wanted to
I never have much fun, that I know
Do you think of me like I hope you do?
Rise my arms to the sky for once
I'm gold
No, I won’t give you up
I can't let you down any more than I have
One more time, I promise to revolve around the sun
Is one more year in servitude enough to pay for all I've done?
I don’t know
Would you wait for me as I long for you?
Rise my arms to the sky for once
I'm gold
No, I won't give you up
I can't let you down any more than I have
No time for giving eulogies
No time for second chance
No time for mixed apologies
Tonight we burn down Hollywood
Tonight's our shared last breath
They'll write about us in history books

Fuck your team, yeah, we gon' knock 'em all off
Biggest bosses, bosses, what's the tab, what's the tab on it?
I had to gamble for this life and put my last on it
Paparazzi taking pics, I got a mac on me
Paparazzi snapping pics, I got that sack on me

Vroom, Yeah, YeahI made some money but I wanna make some more
I fucked her best friend, I wonder, you should know
You see the rarri, you wonder how fast it go

Aye, we be ballin’ all summer
And we be hustlin' all winter
And you have no idea
What it takes to be a winner
I know you wonder
The way I feel is make these niggas choke
Until this shit is painful and it’s impossible to cope
The only magnifying glass I look through is a scope
Snap back leanin' - lyin' face, dangle from my rope
Get to know the meaning
Me and Future, chopper in my coat, while we both be leanin’
Fuckin’ bitches, sloppy on a boat, While my homies sleepin’
Picking up all of this money like it’s only dough I’m sweepin’
Grippin’ up all of this money like you know we only eatin'
Grabbin' up every bag, fuck the talk, we beastin'
Your memory is really gramp, why waste time competin’?
And I know you thinkin' it’s funny - close your mouth
I'm only here to get this money, the fuck you talkin’ ‘bout?
And never doubt we gettin' this dough ‘til it hurts your head
‘Til my accountants fall asleep while they count the bread
I made some money but I wanna make some more
I fucked her best friend, I wonder, you should know
You see the rarri, you wonder how fast it go
These real diamonds if you wonderin’ why it glow

What it takes to be a winner
I know you wonder

Watch when he pull up on ‘em, all the ladies push up on him
Doin' curls with the money, bench press two million
Pull up on ‘em, Rolls Royce, thinkin’ like ten million
Never answer my phone, only pick up when that money ring
Sit up on the stairwell, look at that money ring
Tits around the town, workin’ my cow, ankle weight
Ship it in, lots of pounds, I don’t need an anchor, wait
Break it down, stretch it out, punch it up, work it out
I remember pullin’ up, now all I do is pick it up
First we train the money, it come every day
Thank goodness for my hustle, thank God I got my muscle
I'm ‘bout that cream, a bitch’ll never milk me
Fuck being clean, I’d rather be filthy
I made some money but I wanna make some more
I fucked her best friend, I wonder, you should know
You see the rarri, you wonder how fast it go
These real diamonds if you wonderin’ why it glow
Aye, we be ballin’ all summer
And we be hustlin' all winter

I tried to make up for it, put her in a Beamer
I bought that bitch a crib, been some years since I’ve seen her
I know I’m coming there and hey, I might need her
A gift and a curse when you’re fucking with a hustler
She know I got a curse, she just want me to fuck her
And you still hurt me when I lie to her
I can’t believe it came a day I’m waving bye to her
Can’t believe it came a day I’m waving bye to her

When I jumped off the porch, I was selling that crack like that shit was a sport
I was running through bushes, jumping over fences, I gotta get 'way from them narcs
Hey, man I can never get 'way from this art

Sucking that dick with no hands nowI can't stand the fun we're having
Drifting off and rambling on
With high roads full of mass contusions
My crippling fears, and your designer jeans
You're choking on all your good decisions
While I'm basking in what I settled for
Unmade bed and blanket statements
You're playing house like we're home alone
On and on, so far gone
On and on, I'm so far gone
You're choking on all your good decisions
While I'm basking in what I settled for
What have I waited for?
I'm running out of time
I'm running out of time
I'd give up everything all for a glimpse
On and on, I'm so far gone
On and on, I'm so far gone
On and on, so far gone
On and on, I'm so far gone
And you're choking on all your good decisions
While I'm basking in what I settled for
I'm looking for a sign
I'm looking for a sign
I'm looking for a sign
I did it rightYou were mine when I was young
Why does it take so long?
When you were here, it was warm
Now it's just a bitter storm
Now I'm older, turning white
Watching days turn into nights
Now I'm older and I'm grave
Tell me, what's been left to save?
Pardon my reflection
In the mirror, at your feet
Before you go, please tell me
"Was it all inside of me?"
I'll leave here in the morning
I'll leave here in the morning
I'll leave here in the morning
You were mine when I was young
Why does it take so long?
Now I'm older and I'm grave
Tell me, "what's been left to save?"
I held you in the morning
In the doorway of the sea
"Pardon my reflection
It was all inside of me."

I sent a few niggas frowning when I came through
Jealousy and greed, that's what it done came to

I'm on point now like I still duck from the law
They gettin' mad at us 'cause my niggas won't fall off
My niggas Cash keep the Actavis with him by the bar

Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit try and stretch it to another one
Drinking on that activis, it taste just like some bubble gum
Thumbing through a check, boarding on the jet
Talking on the iphone, sipping out the styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
Vvs and white stones, vvs and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
Free bands on al capone
And my cash way long, 
I see a bunch of clones

On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time
Give me apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that Gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving J's outside crim
Jumping cross me you know your chances slim
In my aviator gucci like I'm driving planes
When the cash hit cash money smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler jumping bail on your ring
Spent so much on Louie gave me free champagne
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I think I'm Magic Don Juan take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film
I rock Gucci I rock Bali at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time

When you were not my Clementine
And I was not your diamond's eye
Bereft, as daisies lie
For our love was not lost in style
You were strong, I was a child
We, we're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers
We, we're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers
And Love, has died in song
Carried down by ancient tongues
Ferried around the water's thrum
And winds, along a line
Along a whirl, a lonely girl
To be, to see, to sweat, and bleed
To fall on your sword-on your sword
On your word
We, we're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers
We, we're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers
Be still, by my side
For you are not my Clementine
And I am not your diamond's eye
To Sleep!
By right of you, I can't endure
In the light of things, I can't ignore
In spite of all the rose's thorns, and hopeless words, and hopeless works
We're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers
We, we're not kings here
We're not the kings here
We're just strangers
We, we're not kings here
We're not kings here
We're just strangers
We, we're not kings here
We're not the kings here
We're just strangers

But with your smile you revive
And if you could only see how you get to me
And if you're wanting this tell me baby
I could make sense of this sentimental trick
Last night we felt it

When I was just a child, a lonely boy
I held onto my dreams, like they could run from me
The hopes I harbored fled - as they often do
But I still dreamed of you
And now my dream's come true
And as we say goodnight, I hold you close and tight
No more raging suns, only waning ones
Like the waxing scar where my lonely heart --
Once bloomed  -- before, I met you
My little dreamer, I'll always
Always, dream of youYeah! It's still Future Hendrix nigga!

Delete this, it's just not trueI saw two stars on a cold autumn night
You said that they were the headlights of an alien car
Coming to tell us that we’ll be alright
Remember you told me that love isn’t blind
Its more like you’re watching the world through a new set of eyes
Finding the colors that usually hide
Oh, I don’t know where I’m going
Oh, I don’t know where I’ll be
But it doesn’t matter
‘Cause every morning
When I wake you’re the first thing I see
Sometimes it's hard to be still in your skin
The questions and outcomes can shake you and spin you and then
You’re back on the floor, you’re back in your head
But if I’m the ocean then you are the tide
Taking my heart in your hands as we move through this life
Greeting the moon hung in the sky
Oh, I don’t know where I’m going
Oh, I don’t know where I’ll be
But it doesn’t matter
‘Cause every morning
When I wake you’re the first thing I see
Oh, oh
Oh, I don’t know where I'm going
Oh, I don’t know where I’ll be
But it doesn’t matter
‘Cause every morning

SOCKS!!!You stood behind the counter
Walked up, keeping my head down
Something, something that moved me now
I shot straight as an arrow
You caught me in your bullseye

So I grabbed my crotch and said 'he-he!'

A gang of shooters in my entourage

Feel like I've been here forever

Already knew you wasn't on my level from yo schedule
Before I settle I chased that cheddar

Don't never file out bout no bitch, she ain't that special
And it ain't all bout glame and glisten cause I'm a treasure
I build my name from con to bricks I can change the weather
It was cloudy around my way I gride hard and never settle
Say when it rains it pours and now its bottles galore
I have done counted so much cans that my hands are sore
We went from rags to riches, two thousands pounds of midget
We got ARs everywhere them hundred round biscuits

I was afraid of what might be
Hiding in the dark and hiding on the streets
For and of what was following me
The hounds of love are calling
I've always been a coward
And I don't know what's good for me
Well, here I go
It's coming at me through the tree
Help me, someone, help me, please
And take my shoes off
And I will throw them in the lake
And I will be two steps on the water
I found a fox, caught by dogs
He let me take him in my hands
His little heart, it beat so fast
That I am ashamed to be running away
From nothing real, I just can't deal with this
I feel ashamed to be there
Amongst your hounds of loving
I feel your arms surrounding me
I've always been a coward
And I dont know what's good for me
Watch, here I go
Don't let me go, hold me down
It's coming at me through the tree
Help me, someone, help me, please
I don't know what's good for me
I don't know what's good for me
Do you know what I need, do you know what I need?
I need a yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Take my shoes off
And I will throw them in the lake
And I will be two steps on the water
Ooh, I know, I know, I know
I don't know what's good for me
I don't know what's good for me
Do you know what I need, do you know what I need?

I think they on to us
I got four or five spots
I think they on to us
All we drive is foreign cars
I think they on to us
Every time I'm in the club I'm with a foreign brand
I swear they on to us
AP or Frank Muller I got choices
I'm in the car by myself I'm hearing voices
Lamborghini, Bentley Coupe, Bentley, Rolls Royces
Gotta the way entourage attracts the task forces
Hand the kush out the DJ booth make it rain
If they find out we in, I might lose my chain
Things might change
Gave the waitress Ben Frank for a drank
She kept the change
Is he rapping? Is he trapping? Bitch, I'm in my own lane
Driving down 75 in a foreign vehicle
On my way to my people
I close examine every vehicle
I can't say what it is right now
I can tell it something fishy going on
Esco and I smell it
I just bought a new watch
I think they on to us
I got four or five spots
I think they on to us
All we drive is foreign cars
I think they on to us
Every time I'm in the club I'm with a foreign brand
I swear they on to us
Spent 5 bands on a fit and wore it for three days
I got 3 main bitches ain't no telling where I stay
Hit the studio all day to stop myself from catching plays
I know the alphabet they looking for the rappers with them K's
My life is more than a stage paranoid why you watchin
Is you watching me preform or is you watching cause you copying
Try to convict me on the ice: I'm rocking
Could it be my ears
Man tell me what it is all these damn designer gear
I'm bout to stop rocking jewelry I can't tell who people is
Just by looking in the crowd you looking blurry over here
Something bout to happen in a minute I can't tell it
Something fishy going on X-Rayed and I smell it!
I just bought a new watch
I think they on to us
I got four or five spots
I think they on to us
All we drive is foreign cars
I think they on to us
Every time I'm in the club I'm with a foreign brand
I swear they on to usI've lost count of the ways I've tried to shut this down
But the flame never goes out
All the dangers I've faced I've taken on my own
I've never had reason to doubt
But you, you've opened through
I've got no defense as you take me over the edge
I don't want to lose control
But the minute I feel you next to me your fire takes hold
Falling like a burning stone
But it feels like you're my gravity
I'm gonna let myself go
The one and only piece that I need to make me feel complete
The rest means nothing to me
The one and only wish that I get is you
Just when you're right there
You know you fill my head, you push my senses over the edge
I don't want to lose control
But the minute I feel you next to me your fire takes hold
Falling like a burning stone
But it feels like you're my gravity
I'm gonna let myself go
Falling into you, there's nothing I can do
I got no defense against you
Falling into you, the ways you pull me through
I keep falling deeper into you
I don't want to lose control
But the minute I feel you next to me your fire takes hold
Falling like a burning stone
But it feels like you're my gravity
I'm gonna let myself go
I don't want to lose control
But the minute I feel you next to me your fire takes hold
Falling like a burning stone
But it feels like you're my gravity
I'm gonna let myself go
I feel you next to me
Next to me, next to me
I feel you next to me
I'm gonna let myself goSmoke kush, fuck bitches, That's the way it go

Either way it go, I'ma smoke a pound of kush
Got a redbone on my line, like to fuck wit crooks
She gotta brain on her, suck a good dick and read books
I'll take lil shawty shoppin, cause I like the way she look
I could put up wit her attitude, plus she ain't a stalker
Inside the cup pink, and I'm playing  wit them dolphins
Ridin' fresh as hell, money in the glove compartment
Goin' cross town, to meet the bitch in her apartment
Got my jewelery on monster, flexin in my Burberry
Saks Fifth shoppin', twenty bags I ain't carry em
Jumpin out the Porsche Cayenne, zippin thru traffic
Money, cars, clothes. Young Future living lavish
Smoke kush, fuck bitches, That's the way it go

Walk in Fifths and buy the store, That's the way it go

I rock red diamonds like a maxi pad
And yellow diamonds like a taxi cab
My closet look like a smash and grab
My driveway look like a launching pad
My English broke, so I'm slurring words
Imma zoo keeper, I'm holdin' birds
My swag absurd, can't be put in words
You old rappers, kicked to the curb
Now the way it go, about 3 or 4
I'mma probably leave wit bout 3 or 4
And they followin and they swallowin
I gotta house so big can't find em in
Or I could get a room and just pile em in
Gucci Mane switchin' up the style again
Gotta hunned mill on my mind again

Hit it wit the fork, Hit it, hit wit the fork
Ion drink unless it's dirty, and I'm higher than a hawk
White and red tiger stripes, I'm in the Aston Martin
I put the roof inside the trunk, the kush be stinkin' like a skunk
I'm the clouds, just what I want. Today I smoked a hundred blunts
I took this bad bitch to lunch, she been hittin' me for a month
Had to make some time for her, I been busy all this money
If I ain't outta town doing shows, you know what I be on
From Benihana to the Intercontinental draped in stones
Wit a pretty yellowbone, and she hold a nice tone
Got a call and a text, hope it's money on my phone
My bitch flying in from Cali, say her flight 3 hours longAbu, it’s your boy!

But if you want it to heal
It just takes time
And you can go up to the Moon
But if you want something to change
You gotta change your life
And take your time
It just takes time
It just takes time
It just takes time
Hard work and your time
And the Sun will leave the room
And leave you to the night
And that's alright
Because before the morning comes
There's a certain calm
And then there's light
It just takes time
It just takes time
A little trust and your time
You can change your life
It just takes time
A little trust and your time
And I can sit and talk
Because I was just like you
So arrogant and brave
Impetuous and blue
But trust me as a friend
And I'll do all that I can do
And I'd do anything for you
Because I want to see you through
It just takes time
Hard work and your time
You can change your life
It just takes time

I go cutthroat, when I'm down and I'm hurting
This a special moment, and we taking full advantage
100 dollar Future, I'll pass them out to all my family
I got this one bitch, I'll put her in the red bottoms
When you dumb rich, and you came from the bottom
Hey, we made our own money

Fuck these niggas they ain't ballin'

Tell me the combination, I'm 'bout to fill it up with racks

When the money come, hater come and you keep some soldiers
They gonna knock a nigga off for you
Just to say they told you
I'mma get the office in the building to make my quota
I can't never have no feelings for bitches, they so rogue-ish
Trying to come to the club with a nigga to get exposure
I'mma buy shawty a bag, I feel sad for her
She can't come around a rich nigga rocking a Coach
I done beat a couple cases and did'n show up at court
Everything Versace, Medusa including my locs
Chiefin' on some good herb
Let’s go and fire up
Black Woodstock!I got back from a long flight
You said you'd meet me there
I've been tripping off constellations and stars
I found you at home, what was our home
With another man, oh man
Been keeping you in my heart
And so I whispered into your ear
"What are you thinking about?"
You just looked up at the stars
And so I whispered into your ear
"Who are you thinking about?"
It couldn't be me
And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without the rivers to tend
Because you remember our love was true
But you just needed a hand
And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without yourself to defend
You know you hurt me so bad
Just ‘cause you needed a hand
And I went off and saw things I’ve never seen
I really wanted you there
But you ruined what was love
Just ‘cause you needed a hand
Just ‘cause you needed a hand
This is the way that it all falls
This is how I feel
This is what I need
You, by me--right here--by me
Right now
And so I whispered into your ear
"What are you thinking about?"
You just looked up at the stars
And so I whispered into your ear
"Who are thinking about?"
It couldn't be me
And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without the rivers to tend
Because you remember our love was true
But you just needed a hand
And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without yourself to defend
You know you hurt me so bad
Just 'cause you needed a hand
And I went off and saw things I've never seen
I really wanted you there
But you ruined what was love
Just cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
Just 'cause you needed a hand
And you can't look me in my eyes anymore
Without the rivers to tend
Because you remember our love was true
But you just needed a hand
And you can't look me in my eyes anymore

You know you hurt me so bad
Just cause you needed a hand
And I went off and saw things I've never seen

I got a couple hundred way I can use you, right
You pull up in that whip all black, with a bitch in the back
But she wanna come through? Fuck that
Know you wanna touch that
I be waiting up in the room number 302
Two cups of tequila get your mind on
I can't be, be faithful when we're not alone
Physical attraction, I ain't gotta tax him
You know what he want when he ready
You been going steady with the girl of your dreams
But the girl in your bed ain't shit like me
So meet me in my room, put your cellphone off
Searching for the one, baby you look lost
So when you wanna play, I can be your jerk
Like I came from the bay
Say that you in love but the love ain't real
Cause if you was in love, you wouldn't wanna feel
All of my body
Say what's on your mind, tell me you're mine
Need you a chick in yourlife, let me get in your life
You've been having stress, let me pull you up
Watch while I undress, let me show you some
I know you wanna hit that

Right about eleven, going on twelve
Just ring my bell and if she asks, don't give her details, got it

Don't feel bad, it'll be fun, just come and stay
Take another shot, make you feel right
When it's wrong that you're not, face that truth
What you wanna do

Wanna meet me there, baby, wanna meet me there?

Know you wanna touch that
I be waiting up in the room number 302Inspiring, shining, rising
And when you're in my way
I'm not dividing me from you cause we're working together
Perfect in its splendor like the currents of the weather
The splinter in my center hindering all of my pleasure
Re-manifested as you in this endeavor
Once responsibility is taken I can render
Experience to be however I want to remember
Time and time again we fall in to the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find
Put yourself through the scariest of scenarios
Enter experiences you normally wouldn't dare to go
It's all for the character and the arrogant afterglow
Of knowing it's appearance according to your patterns of growth
And what your parents handed down to you to handle
Make sure you carry torches when their puttin out your candles
Prediction can be unkind but unwind them still
Don't erase the part of you that's responsible for your will
Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find
Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find
Well I've seen you and those things you do
And the way you hide that shadow can't be good for you
Your dark defines your light
There's some utterly damaged particles to deal with
And if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift
When stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to lift
I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist
Well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed
You dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist
And there's no way to get back experiences you missed
So start right now today and risk furiousness for bliss
Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find
Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find
Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are
Time and time again we fall into the debts of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find
You just can't keep running away from what you're trying to findPluto!

...down in the hood, need to come catch this fade
You acting hard on SnapChat, come catch this fade
I'mma have Kendall Jenner going crazy
I'mma have mama Kris tryna save me
They tryna get me off the syrupNiggas ain't aiming at your chest, shooters aim straight for the top
I don't even wanna fuck these hoes no more man all I want is the top
Even in the winter time we cop these drops and drops in the top
Came from the projects and got on the grind shot straight to the top
We on top, we on top, we on top
We on top, we on top
They sleepin' on the seventh floor, thinking no no
They got 28 floors, we on the 28th floor
We on top
Lil Mexico the army, Freeband the marine
Some million dollars in the building when I'm on the scene
Flacko what it is, you know it's all love
Back to back Lambo, me and big cuz
Scooter got the 'Rari making juugs and catching plays
Two cup, filled up, drankin' on Aid
Throwin' money off stage, standing on stage
Won't shop at Fifth Plaza, go shop in LA
International liking all my freaks exotic

Gucci, Fendi, Dolce, YSL, picka closet
You can die paid, we got one, two options
28th floor I got 28 sold
Whole thangs only, ain't no 28th though
Brick on top of brick they go for 28 for
Bales on retail, 400 I let 'em go
All these freebands I ain't gotta change no more
Camaro outta oldschool, I bought off selling dope
Bentley coup and  finessed out Mexico
Bitch I'm Young Scooter, do what the fuck I want
All this damn money, nigga everything for show
To count a quarter ticket, G told me it's a go
Hustle, juug, and stack it is the only thing I know
Juug house bunkin, Black Amigo Gang, gone

Fuck them old hoes, I got new hoes
Bitch on Insta turnt up in the presidential house

A simple trip far as they could see
The sky was clear and the hour serene
But did they know what the night would bring?
Lonely hearts strung across the land
They've been waiting long for a healing hand
My heart was there and I felt the chill
When love came down and the earth stood still
When love came down and the earth stood still
Shepherds stirred under starry skies
Tasting grace that would change their lives
The angels trembled and the demons did too
For they knew very well what pure grace would do
The hope of the world and a baby boy
I remember Him well like I was there that night
My heart was there and I felt the chill
Love came down and the earth stood still
Love came down and the earth stood still
Love came down and the earth stood stillWe drop a kilo on you head nigga

Then I copped the coupe for you no time
Then I copped a Rollie for you both times
Then I stepped your fashion game up lately
I'm just tryna ask you, what it do, baby?
What it do, baby? What it do, baby?
What it do, baby? What it do?
Real talk, I'm fuckin' with you and you know it
Ain't just talkin' with you, baby, I'm a poet
Ayy, I just throwed a couple G's on your feet
I just throwed a couple G's on your feet
I'm just ballin' just to show you we can ball

Play your position, can't be playin' niggas cheap
Niggas like me would put sand sheets on your seat
We be fuckin' in the AM, I'ma hit you past 3
Ayy, that's the same way that I fell for you
I used to come through, roll some L's with you
We shared a bond and the bid was long overdue
That's why we was in here drinkin' Hennessy
We tryna get out all our memories 
Ain't none of your ex's my enemy
They damn sure ain't no friend of me 
What got me to this point?
I'm really fuckin' with you, spendin' cash on that ass
Got to layin' up with you, pulled off when I smashed
You let me have my way, I got this good girl goin' bad
I ain't treat you like trash, what I'm really tryna ask
What it do, baby?
Then I copped the coupe for you no time
Then I copped a Rollie for you both times
Then I stepped your fashion game up lately
I'm just tryna ask you, what it do, baby?
What it do, baby? What it do, baby?
What it do, baby? What it do?Here I come, come to You in the very clothes
That I killed, killed You in and now I know I’m alone
I walk to you, rain falls from you
Can You wash me, can You drown me?
I wanna be a lot of things, so much pent up inside of me
I wanna be stronger, too long I’ve sat here undecidedly
Planning strategy, half of me knows it’s all just a fallacy
Failing miserably, drastically and then I crash dramatically
Into a wall I’ve hit a hundred times before
And yet I still ignore the dark red blood stains on the floor
And I’m back in front of You, Lord, with the blood on the floor
Is the blood mine or yours? Don’t wanna do this anymore
Back and forth between bein' me and who You call me to be
You see a man free who thinks he has to buy a key
To a door but he can’t ‘cause he’s poor and he can’t
Fall down anymore ‘cause he’s already on the floor
And his heart is broken and all and this is his scar
But it’s warm from cryin' ‘cause he will try nine times
To realize nine crimes but he has more than nine lives
So he picks himself up and keeps fightin' for the prize again
Here I come again to You
Just to show the blood soaked through
Through my bones and all I own
Is there a way for me to know?
I walk to you, rain falls from you
Can You wash me, can You drown me?
Every time I feel selfish ambition is takin' my vision
My crime is my sentence, repentance is takin' commission
It’s takin' a toll on my soul, I’m screamin' submission and
I don’t know if I am dyin' or livin'
‘Cause I will save a face for the name of sake
Abuse a grace, take a aim to obtain a new name in a newer place
But my name is lame, I can’t walk and I ain’t the same
And my name, I became a new destiny to the grave and
They say the ocean’s blue but it’s black right now
In the dark, on the sand, lookin' out at my crowd
Depression and drownin', singin' now the full parts
Of lightning reveals where the ocean stops and the sky starts
I’ve been told by the sky that the ocean I shall win
But it’s hard for me to see where ocean stops, and sky begins
A random strike of light reminds me of what is true
But right now the ocean is blacker than black, the sky is too 
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
WhoaYeah, bitch we drippin' down in billions

Got that penthouse to play, I paid the whole year up

But I'll be damned
If I ain't gonna grab the bull by the horns
And it may put me in an early grave
But I won't have it no other way
And goddamn, how I miss my friends
Chasing empty dreams and left me helpless
Cause no one knows me like you anymore
As long forgotten as a debt I owe
Cause we've turned our love into a rodeo
But I'll be damned
If I ain't gonna grab the bull by the horns
So let me down baby to an early grave

Three hunnid on the zip, tell 'em pour up You couldn't possibly know how much you mean to me
You couldn't honestly look inside my tarot
You couldn't possibly find it in your heart to forgive me
You are the savage sun and scarecrow
And time -- goes by
And you've got a lot to learn, in your life
And the heart's not inside
And I've got to find the one that's just right
You offer all amends in hopes of saving me
You never imagined I could be strong without you
You offer me a branch of peace that bleeds through
The thorns that welcomed me -- now speak truth
And time -- goes by
And you've got a lot to learn, in your life
And the heart's not inside
And I've got to find the one that's just right
And time -- goes by
And you've got a lot to learn, in your life
And the heart's not inside
And I've got to find the one that's just right
Find the one that's just right

It made my daddy feel neglected 
Feelin' like dynamite, this PJ done went to my head
Fuck the TSA, we boarding the jet with the lead on us
I copped a brand new wraith, ain't even come with a head on it
And they had to drop the case, 'cause I had to much cash on it
I ain't even gonna' lie, I'm doin' a little stressin'
I spent me a milly on a Jetin
I'ma go ahead and shoot, I ain't doin' no tusslin'
I ain't even gonna' lie, I 'done got a lil rusty, ey
We plantin' seeds like its sesame
Baby you should see all my accessories
I used to wanna be like the Jetson's
Then they passed me the ball, and I went flushin'
Ever since then, I ain't stopped'
Poppin' purses, Jesus I'm a space cadet, federal gate
Word to Birdman, Bed-Stuy got like 50 boroughs, ey
Mink is on my floor, look like a bear just hibernatin'
I can put different ice on err'day
I popped a pill, but I ain't skressin' 
'Cause I got rich with no direction 
And I been doin' way to much flexin' 
And then my daddy feel neglected 
Feelin' like dynamite, this PJ done went to my head
Fuck the TSA, we board the jet with the lead on it
I copped a brand new wraith, it ain't come with a head on it
And they had to drop the case, 'cause I had to much cash on it
And I keep the brick fair, and my back pocket
Put it on God, I got rich like Michal Ansky 
I'm out the gutter, but I admit I'm a little fancy 
While you be imitating, I'm constantly gravitating 
Any time i step out; Aquafina Water 
Whip that Lamborghini, like I'm in a Charger 
Gettin' that fettuccine, I can't help but spoil her
You my side hoe, but I treat you like a starter 
And I got over 50 watches in my duffle
And It hurt to say it, 'cause my daddy still struggle
I played with skreets, then found my way, I learned to hustle
I murder your mamma 'bout my brother
I popped a pill, but I ain't skressin' 
'Cause I got rich with no direction 
And I been doin' way to much flexin' 
And then my daddy feel neglected 
Feelin' like dynamite, this PJ done went to my head
Fuck the TSA, we board the jet with the lead on it
I copped a brand new wraith, it ain't come with a head on it
And they had to drop the case, 'cause I had to much cash on itIntro..

Baba akoo 
Cheke aaaah
Mbona nlishayakimbiza  toka kipindi ya Nyerere
Nikayamwagia upupu yaliponimwagia nyenyere
Joh usidere usoni unapouwa ngedere
Akunyimae kunde si amekunyima ushuzi wa njegere
Siku hizi kuna majini ndani ya mapaka
Ndo maana kila ndoa kuna talaka
Ipi unataka?? ya msituni au ya machaka
So, ukiparamia mtambo ndo utaipata
Daily namwomba Mungu anipe muke niwowe
Sio anipe msiba daily kwangu ni yowe
Aje kibaka anitepeteshe nilowe
Halafu aniache nanja juu nimenyoosha kidole.. cha kati
Hizi ni nyakati za kuvunga
Nakupenda we tu na ndo maana nakuchunga
Mi sinaga hata koloni la kuzuga
Ni wewe tuu kwahiyo ukizingua ntakuvunja
Haaaah
Sina koloni koloni , sina koloni koloni

Sina koloni koloni sina koloni koloni, Nimejitakatisha
Sina koloni koloni sina koloni, koloniii eeeh eeh eeh eehe
Sina koloni koloni, sina koloni koloni eeeh eeh eeh eh
Mi mambo mengi nilimalizaga hukoo
Tena nilipokuona  we ni mrembo nikaku-fall
Ilikuwa ni usiku kuelekea mapambazuko
Si ndo nkagongana na gari la upendo uso kwa uso
Mi sio domo zege, wala mi sio play boy
Ku stiki na wewe ndito huwaga mi na pray doi
Nikikutajaga kwetu oi oi
Bless toka kijenge, mwanama, banana , suye na moivoi
Masela unishauri mkuu hao unapakata
Kwani we si unakisu mkuu hao unawakata
Sishawishiki juu yako utaona hao wanakacha
Ni nafuu ya mchukuzi ile kuvuja kwa pakacha
Nshakula ujana hizi ni nyakati za kuvunga
Nakupenda wewe tuu na ndo maana nakuchunga
Mi sinaga hata koloni la kuzuga
Ni wewe tuu kwa hiyo ukizingua ntakuvunja

Ya ya ya ya ya 
Talkin' bout ya poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' bout 100 bottles, nigga, you ain't pop shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spendin' money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit
Shit, shit
I ain't tryna hear a whole bunch of that 
About how many bodies you caught 
My niggas is real thug niggas, them real niggas don't talk
Worldstar niggas get caught, wavin' all them guns at the cameras
Grown ass nigga, you ain't bout to shoot , you don't do 
You just think it's cool  to move bricks
Real niggas do it cause they got to
I know them real niggas and it's not you
And if they see yo' ass round here frontin'
Real shooter be somewhere and shot you
Man, get the fuck out the booth poppin' that 
Corny ass nigga just talkin' that 
Heard about it, read about it, never been around it
But you think ya soft ass give somebody that 
How you movin' round with ya ho?
You ain't even stickin' to the code
You don't even represent the life right
Pussy nigga sleepin' with a night light
Comin' for ya head like Fight Night
I can get anything done for the right price, boy!
 Take that
Frontin' like you really on that bullshit
Gun him down, make a motherfucker do a full flip, chip chip
Nigga really really on that Crip shit
Bisquick whip, whip, whip, nigga, move it!
Got the toolie, yeah, the piece, I'mma use it
Nigga ruthless, leave a chump nigga toothless
Tell him "smooches", got that white girl
Get a tan when I ice her, Arm and Hammer
Mixin' venom like a viper, you the buyer
I'm the nigga with the fire, you's a minor
Now I'm major with the paper, coppin' acres
Overseas like a sailor, you a hater
And ya daddy in the same boat, you a busta when ya chain go
Pourin' syrup on my Eggo, four liters for the eight though
To the face, now the day slow, you's a fruity lil' rainbow
Real nigga, call me Django, 50 seconds till the say low
Wild bucks shootin' halos, every pocket got a bank roll
I don't think you really understand me 
Groovy Q ain't keep the nose candy 
Yeah, man
Y'all niggas thought I was dead?
Boo, nigga, boo! Boo!

Brrrrr! Stick'em
Fuck you and every nigga came with ya
Go and put a nigga on a picture
Go and put a nigga on a T-shirt
Back in the day when a nigga sell dope
I'mma slap your daddy out and then put him in a hole
Glock 40, whooo! Turn up, turn up
My ambitions as a rider
Sippin' on lean, gettin' higher
Nigga, I'm a codeine buyer
Know you not a foreign whip driver
Shout out to the shooters and the shooters only
You never walk around with a lot of money
Bundles fallin' all out your pocket
When you hit him in the head, can you keep a solid?
Bulletproof whip, we'll blow it up
Like some raw uncut, don't blow it up
Represent your gang, nigga, throw it up
I don't give a fuck where you at, nigga, throw it upDJ Esco Set

All summer long, I'm dropping BOMBS
Still pulling up to the marathon
Font of the pack, see me run alone
Crossing the line, bet I finish strong
I was on the freeway, on the way
Car full of brown boys, andalé
See me when I swerve on a rainy day
Cops on my tail like I ran away
Estupidos, estupidos, estupidos, estupidos, estupidos everywhere
They focus on terrorists, terrorists, terrorists
Fix up your MediCare
I know my parents been working hard
Just to give me a life in the States
But Russia done booked me for 20K
And my hometown want me to pay to play

I feel like Johnny Depp
Out in Paris with them bands
I feel like Brad Pitt
Holding Angelina's hand
I feel like Johnny Depp
Out in Paris with them bands
I feel like Brad Pitt
Holding Angelina's handThe music industry is lying to you
It is telling you that you are excited
And you are excited
And you are excited
Or rather you have confused excitement with the fear of missing out
Which is understandable as these two feelings are very closely related
Focusing as they do, on the heart and the groin
And ending in a bloody mess, pregnancy tests and too little sleep
Our survey says that shouting inanities in a regional accent is valuable to culture
Look at Eastenders, Soccer AM or the Queen's Speech
Our survey says paedophiles run the BBC
But look at the alternatives
Drowning men clutching at straws through their bell-end helmets
Sad women dreaming of being owned by them
Their children eventual despoilers of the high streets clad head-to-toe in menstrual blood
Screaming sexual insults into bedroom mirrors with the sad belief it will empower them
And it will empower them
And it will empower them
At least that’s what it says on my cereal packet
That’s what it says on my receipt from the Apple Store
Good lord
I cannot identify the bloodied bodies of my loved ones
They were killed whilst watching a new television show on the MTV network
One where Kim Kardashian is chased through woodland by a giant bear wearing a mask which carries the visage of recently deceased film director Michael Winner
The bear has apparently not qualified for a workplace pension and is angry with Daniel Day Lewis for what he perceives to be the relative lack of action in There Will Be Blood
Which he otherwise enjoyed but found a little precious for his tastes
Anyway, after 20 minutes of panicked running around intercut with interviews with friends and other celebrities
The production team behind the show all simultaneously come to the same horrifying conclusion
They've wasted the precious gift of life which has been given to them by science
They start attacking themselves with the nearest available objects
Breaking off camera tripods to ram them bloodily into each other’s eyes
Climbing up the highest branches of trees to fall face down on to the pulsing earth
The whole time shrieking and screaming with the sudden primal vigour of lost souls who have forgotten language and seem intent on shouting their black hearts from their grey, semi-erect chests
Quite
They face the pigs
They face the pigs they were
They face the pigs
They face the pigs they were
Anyway, my family members, otherwise enjoying a restful Sunday afternoon spent basking in the Christian lie of a benevolent and loving God
Witness this horror through the prism of their television set
Concentrated hard on the psychic bloodied anguish which has utterly enveloped the unlikely woodland scene and is transmitted directly into the heart of our living room
And they burst from the screen and into their eyes and their hearts and their minds and their tits and their bits
And they burst from the screen and into their eyes and their hearts and their minds and their tits and their bits
And they burst from the screen and into their eyes and their hearts and their minds and their tits and their bits
And they burst from the screen and into their eyes and their hearts and their minds and their tits and their bits
And they burst from the screen and into their eyes and their hearts and their minds and their tits and their bits
And they burst from the screen and into their eyes and their hearts and their minds and their tits and their bits
Thoughts echo off their foreheadsIma tell you niggas like this
Ok, Ok
Yall niggas got problems
What the fuck I got?
Burners
What the fuck you saying to a real ass nigga
Come through the streets I got my car on ice skates
What the fuck you saying to me dawg im mean
Off top pavement, hit him in his splien
Dot com waves, chain all glazed
Bitches on sight, bitch I dont write
The AK 47 leave a nigga hungry
Red sauce on his shirt bowl of raviolli
Im making that cheese bowl of maccarroni
Ima make you my new tendaronni
Creep into your crib ill kill ya daughter and your son
Then I hit you up with a fucking water gun
With the odd future water gun its on the shirt
Ill put you on a shirt leave you in the dirt
You ain't ready to lead the rap
Hold up hold up.... bring it back
Bring it back
Niggas think the ak shit dont split
I dont give a fuck I fucked my bitch
In her pussy
What the fuck you looking at
You got a problem nigga
I can show you were we cooking at
Real nigga off top with the fist

YeahI found some peace today
I grit my teeth
And swallow all my pain and selfish pride
I used to hide behind
Let me out, let me out I'm singing
Let me out, let me out I'm singing
I'm a liar and a cheat in prison
Accused of telling the truth
Flames of pain strained paint my eyes
Child I've lost this face won't lie
Time burns my soul, decays to gray
Sifting through the smoke and lies
Swimming exhale our love that's died
First and last ain't ever the same, so I'll keep on singing this
I don't care if you're right or if I'm always wrong
Just want to sing my song before this whole world
Now and forever
I stand to sever all ties and connections with recollections of pain or fear
Family, society, authority and every peer
Swallowing tears, lining my stomach
I'm getting freer every second eroding and exploding
All these corporate deceptions right here
I'm out
Metal prison bars block our minds
Youth's truth sold and televised
I never bough it and I won't play your games for fame
Are we just rats in a piper's tune soothed
Scraping for cheese in a maze made to lose
No I'm not and I won't eat your food, subdued
I don't care if you're right or if I'm always wrong
Just want to sing my song before this whole world
Gone
Let me out, let me out I'm singing
Let me out, let me out I'm singing
I'm out

When you're drunk, you get typical in every kind of way
A digital delusion, your posts don't get too far
Intercepting the visible perception who you are
Tell me that I'm wrong
Tell me that I'm wrong
You can't, so get gone
Tell me that I'm wrong
You got a pocket full of rain that just keeps on giving
Not to mention a mouth, that self proclaims it's wise
Running toward the same road, you've done this all before
Then jump back into your own lie, girl who's this really for?
I'm praying that I'm wrong
Tell me that I'm wrong
You can't, so get gone
Tell me that I'm wrong
What do you take me for?
I'm not the fool you saw
How can you be so sure?
What do you take me for
Tell me that I'm wrong
Tell me that I'm wrong
You can't, so get gone

Take my mind to somewhere else, where I'm all alone
But then you step outta the stone faced crowd
Like a wave's come crashing in, made the whirlpool spin, n' you lift me out
 x8
Magnetic eyes
There's no going back you've pulled me in to the night
Magnetic eyes
Closer till our broken hearts collide
Split apart by frozen miles of wind and rain
I can feel your desert heat pulling again
But then you step outta the stone faced crowd
Like a wave's come crashing in, made the whirlpool spin, n' you lift me out...
Blue!
You're so magnetic your army is a soldier
Like a force from out of this world you pull me closer
Barriers blown apart, you're still a world afar
I think i'm drowning in the pool of hearts
But then you step outta the stone faced crowd
Like a wave's come crashing in, made the whirlpool spin, n' you lift me out...
N' you lift me out
N' you lift me out
N' you lift me out
N' you lift me out
 x8
Magnetic eyes
There's no going back you've pulled me in to the night
Magnetic eyes
Closer till our broken hearts collideHe sits low, in a shady grove
Where the trees arc slow, in the shape of 'you know'
Marble stairwells, waterfalls, egrets' heads and open arms
Whistling through his pensive teeth, the scene is set to peak
Like how the desert meets the reef
And steals the heart - of the thief
She walks slow, past the reach of home
In a Western World, far from the things she knows
Hanging gardens, patterned walls, the books of Rilke, orchestras
Motioning to the slow refrain, the soul is set to gain
Or swallow it whole
The causal chain - of human loam
And as seasons go, it's a lot like this
He reasons for a look, then a glance
To the path, where she passed
From the page of a book, to a perch in the grass
And as meetings go, it's a lot like this
She tiptoes from the path, to the edge of the page
Where she dared - to be asked
What's in a name?
What is your name?
And if you let me know
I won't be alone, I won't be alone
And if you have the time to talk to
I won't doubt you, doubt in you, doubt in you
And if I let you know
I won't be alone, I won't be alone
And if you, as if you start to fall
I'll be here to catch you
Turning around, he sighs, "will you sit next to me?"
Motioning forward, she replies, "will you walk next to me?"
"I know my lines, and there's a lot less space and a little bit of time"
"I know the play - It's fine"
Echoing herself, she says, "will you walk close to me?"
Holding his smile, he replies, "what more would you ask of me?"
"I know my mind, and there's a lot less space and a little bit of time"
"I know the way - It's fine"
And if you let me know
I won't be alone, I won't be alone
And if you have the time to talk to
I won't doubt you, doubt in you, doubt in you
And if I let you know
I won't be alone, I won't be alone
And if you, as if you start to fall
I'll be here to catch you
He's wasting time, you gotta take it slow
May never get a chance like this
And she knows he's wasting time
And she loves the way he tries
Even though she knows the lines
She's taking time, you gotta let things grow
May never have a chance like this
And he knows she takes her time
And he keeps along her side
All hopes to keep along her side
And as seasons go, it's a lot like this
He reasons for a look, then a glance
To the path, where she passed
From the page of a book, to a perch in the grass
And as meetings go, it's a lot like this
She tiptoes from the path, to the edge of the page
Where she dared to be asked
What's in a name?
What is your name?Yeah, I ain’t never been this high
You ain’t never been this high
I been fly since my baby pictures
Alligator on my shirt I been too consistent
I had a beeper in the kindergarten with a gerry curl
And I always got the pretty girls
I’m shinin like Vvs’s I was born shinin’
Matter of fact I should’ve been a diamond
My left wrist Aquafina and these girls im with from Argentina
Body flooded up with ice name a rapper cleaner
Came in photogenics sky ain’t the limit for me
Turnt myself to a astronaut, if you believe you can achieve
I want ya spot homie numero uno
And I brought a check with me bigger than a sumo
Blood Sweat Tears inside this rap as I flow
I know some niggas dead and gone want the best for me
And I know some niggas living praying for the worst for me
I seen darker days I know this ain’t the end for me
That’s why every chance I get cuz I’mma give em hell
Me and my niggas we the last real niggas left
Me and my niggas we the realest niggas left
It’s like my body made of diamonds, I can’t stop shinin’
I ain’t never been this high 
I ain’t never been this high 
I’m shinin’ over everybody around me 
You ain’t never been this high 
You ain’t never been this high 
International future don’t follow my footsteps
Every pair of Jordan’s done came out I had em ‘fore they hit the shelf
Air Force One’s I prolley have 2.000 left
I ain’t gave away I’m donating Ralph Lauren
I had every pair of skippers from the green to orange
Yellow Blue White three stripes Adidas suits
All day I dream about selling dope like shootin’ hoops
One day you dreamin’ then you wake up to reality
First you lose your heart then your true friends disappear
I was already shinin’ fore I got here
I told myself I’ll get my feet off ground I’m goin’ outta here
I’m taking some people I never would thought even be here
Everything I went thru it’s a purpose why I’m still here
Hard work perservere keep them people in your ear and them people in your rear
Me and my niggas we the last real niggas hereIt's 3:20 AM

Ain’t been out a month already on my sixth pound
Leanin' off this drank I need to sit down
Baddest bitches in the game they wanna get down

I made a promise to myself that I’mma die rich 
My cup is polluted cause I’m on Actavis 
And the way a nigga ballin’ is like a Athlete 
I got expensive habits, and I’m hard to reach
Cause I’m in Pluto, I’m double cupping’ on Dro
And I play the piano, my pockets on sumo
I’m plugged in with Migo, I can get a taco
And if you wanna cash out I bring it to your front door
Can’t turn me down, Can’t turn me down
I hit the lot with stupid knots and double down

They won’t talk enough money so I turned it down
Multi million dollar deal offer thats a turn around

Looking out at the world we're in

The sun will fall, the moon will rise
I promise you I'll say goodnight
Now we do the same thing every time
This is not some one-way mirror
Looking out at the world we're in
We are the love, we are the love we give

Did a lot with baking soda, red and white, Coca Cola
DOCE what that is Doce Doce from the flo’ up
From the flo’ up millennium I’m on M&M’s get plenty them
275 come seventy five get in the mix with 20 chicks
Come to city take a pic
You made a jugg today, okay I’m making jugg all the time
You just start getting money, we been get money all the time
You buy a outfit out the mall, we buy mall out all the time
200 on the dash catch me riding foreign all the time
You pour up once a week, I drank on lean more den all the time
True Religion Robin Jeans Designer on me all the time
Everytime we hit the club we make a movie all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time, all the timeThere's a fire escape
At the end of the gate where I'm standing
There's a ladder that goes
To a safe place below on the ground
But I don't need it now
It's too soon to go down to the bottom
I will wait 'til it's close
When I'm needing it most
When I'm scared
I will look out into the starred sky
With your help now, I will be all right
Oh, my future, I can't believe it's time
No, my lover, I'll never leave you behind
Oh, my future, I can't believe it's time
No, my lover, I'll never leave you behind
There's a pattern of stones
Laying out in a row by the river
We have started to climb
With a hand on the side of the wall
But I'm too stunned to call
I'm hoping it all will be over
With the radio on
With the waterfall gone
We will go
I will look out into the starred sky
With your help now, I will be all right
Oh, my future, I can't believe it's time
No, my lover, I'll never leave you behind
Oh, my future, I can't believe it's time
No, my lover, I'll never leave you behind
Oh, my future, I can't believe it's time
No, my lover, I'll never leave you behind
Oh, my future, I can't believe it's time
No, my lover, I'll never leave you behind
No, no, leave you behind, no, no
Oh, my future, I can't believe it's time
No, my lover, I'll never leave you behindIt's time to wake up
It's time to change
Let's get it started
I feel like there's so much to rearrange
Come on, I need your help with this
Why don't we get it started with a kiss?
If memory serves
Then why am I still waiting for it to return?
My head feels like it's just about to slip
This morning is just a blur
Today lingers on like a bad year
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
Beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
We get along well
We talk a lot
I made some promises
I guess that I totally forgot
Forgive me, my mind is elsewhere
Feels like somebody's thrown it down the stairs
It's not good enough
I thought you knew enough about it but you still want more
Today I don't feel so ill
If only I could bide the time I want to kill
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
Beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
Beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
Beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twistIn the end everybody wins
As long as we remember there's a reason for incredible wealth 
Incredible luck 
Don't despair, life is just a dream
And nobody can judge us if we choose to face it gradually 
Makes everything right 
Come join, come join our hopeless cause
Come join, come join our lost cause
Come join, come join our hopeless cause
Come join, come join our lost cause
Turn around, face our deepest fears
Re-imagine God as just a mental illness
Looming towards 
The end of our days 
Think again how could we go wrong with supernatural creatures who control our fate
Could anyone tell? 
Would anyone care ? 
Come join, come join our hopeless cause
Come join, come join our lost cause
Come join, come join our hopeless cause
Come join, come join our lost cause
The feeling snaps the fools behind
And back in the ground we look at our hands
And wonder aloud could anyone choose to die
The feeling snaps the fools behind
And back in the ground we look at our hands
And wonder aloud could anyone choose to die

And back in the ground we look at our hands
And wonder aloud could anyone choose to die

And back in the ground we look at our hands
And wonder aloud could anyone choose to dieI'm in Hamburg for a week
Do you know a nice Thai place?
I have a birthday while I'm there
Call an undertaker
I'm a prisoner of fun
Completely especially anatomically blown-up
For the lesser mortals
For the listener's boredom
At the speed of sound
At the speed of sound

Do you know a dead shopkeeper?
A new immigrant I think
Call the undertakers

I can promise the best selection of curry houses
Within a 25km radius
The postman flew the longest distance is the answer
To any trivia question -- merry christmas!

The faithful assets only know their master's love
The faithful assets only know their master's loveThere's tears in heaven
There's fears in hell
You're loud to speak
But you're quiet to tell
Of your Haunted Love
Oh Haunted Love
Of your Haunted Love
Leave me alone tonight...
Oh Haunted Love
Leave me alone tonight
Oh Haunted Love
Leave me alone tonight
There's distance left and a hollowed home
Spirits call to make sure I'm alone
With your Haunted Love
Oh Haunted Love
Of your Haunted Love
Leave me alone tonight

Leave me alone tonight
Life is pain
Our pain is desire

Bury me in our secret place
Where no one will find me
Bury me in our secret place
Where no one will find meAs processions fade
New hearts doubt
But you are Golden and no one questions it
But who you fake and how you sound
Asks the best of men
To share your sentiment
I want to be the one to help you find those years
That you've been talking about
Dreaming of the South
And all those lost goodbyes
And all those lonely tears
You never got to cry
It never works out right
Unless you're one to follow
Where the silence takes too long
When the night falls--when the night falls oh so slow
And caution isn't ours
When the night falls--when the night falls oh so low
We may lose control
I want to be the one to help you find those years
That you've been talking about
Dreaming of the South
And all those lonely nights
And all those lost goodbyes
You never got to sigh
I want to be the one to help you find those dreams
Because you've been hanging around
Talking about the South
And all those balmy nights
And all those lonely songs
You never got to write
And I'll hold your hand as I walk you through the door
And I'll hold your hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as you held my hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as you held my hand as I walk you through that door
And I'll hold your hand as you held my hand as I walk you through that doorAbu! It's ya boy! Pop that shit, mane
Man, pour up, mane
I'm talkin' 'bout that Texas mud, mane
Oh, my god, nigga, kickstand, mane
Oh, my god nigga, I'm talking 'bout that dirty sprite, fool!This is a brand new problem
A problem without any clues
If you know the clues
It's easy to get through
But you look confused and you don't know what to do
It's hard to give an answer if you haven't got a clue
If you work it out tell me what you find
If the least you can do is show some restraint
Then the most you can do is get carried away
I can see that you look confused and you don't know what to do
Say what you see
What you like
If you work it out tell me what you find
We can have a few decent days and nights
If you're meant to be here and you want to be late
The best thing you can do is get lost on the way
I can see that you look confused and you don't know what to do
Say what you see
What you like
If you work it out tell me what you find
We can have a few decent days and nights
We can have a few
We can have a few
We can have a few
Decent days and nights
We can have a few
We can have a few
We can have a few
Decent days and nights
If you want to make a guess you should know it's not a game
'Cause you'll never get another chance to make a guess again
This is a brand new problem
A problem without any clues
If you know the clues
It's easy to get through
But you look confused and you don't know what to do
It's hard to give an answer if you haven't got a clue
If you want to make a guess you should know it's not a game
And you'll never get another chance to make a guess again
If you work it out tell me what you findYou're breathing life into hearts of stone
And moving mountains to make it known
That You are God through the quaking earth
And I'm alive 'cause You spoke the word
Set my pulse to the beat of Yours
Keep my footsteps right on course
Light my way like the sun brightens day
Lead me home
Now shaking off every weight and fear
My hope alive in Your promise here
I give my all every chance I get
This life is Yours from start to end
Set my pulse to the beat of Yours

I know You hold my life-
I'm Yours to my very last heartbeat
I'm moving everywhere You lead me
Yours, all my days and forever
I know You hold my life togetherHave you ever been part of
A criminal conspiracy?
It really is incredible fun
Once the boring paper work is done
A man could get used to it
Have you ever had posters
That seemed to watch you
When you were sleeping?
I found them all underneath the sink
Drunk and conferring
One drink for the limits of battleships
Two drinks for the limits of coal
Three drinks for the pilots
One drink for the limits of battleships
Two drinks for accountants
Have you every known anyone
Who could wear a hat indoors
Without guns or bodyguards
To impress on the bare-headed hoards
That the choice was a reasonable one?
Have you ever been wound up
To the point of prison food?
So far, so tame
Everybody has a prick in the game
But have you ever been to bed with Elaine?
One drink for the limits of battleships
Two drinks for the limits of coal
Three drinks for the pilots
Four drinks for the permanent residents
Five drinks on the golf course
No drinks for the enemy combatants
No drinks for the door-staff
No drinks for the tireless testers
No drinks
It's only the way of the world, I have heard
It's only the way of the world
